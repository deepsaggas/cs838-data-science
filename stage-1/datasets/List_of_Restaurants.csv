"Lunetta","Lunetta is not one of those Italian places that get the vibe right and the food wrong: Adam Shepard can cook."

"Pranna","Pranna delivers some unimaginative entrees, though the restaurant's trademark assortment of satays are more impressive."
"Abboccato","The menu at Abboccato, the 21st-century version of an Italian-American restaurant, is a bit of a jumble, but often a pleasing one."
"Babushka Cafe","Babushka Cafe has a few stools at a window counter, heavy-eyelashed matryoshka dolls standing sentinel and a terse menu devoted to pelmeni, vareniki, blini and borscht."
"Barbuto","Service and food are inconsistent, but Barbuto's formidable charms win out in the end."
"Anton’s Dumplings","Anton Yelyashkevich, who was born in Minsk, Belarus, and grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, serves small but robust dumplings, made by hand at a pelmeni factory in Brooklyn."
"Russ & Daughters Cafe","The new Russ & Daughters Cafe is modeled on the old Russ & Daughters shop a few blocks away. But the cafe adds to, elaborates on and deviates from the store in many ways."
"SpaHa Soul","“This is the most informal dining experience you’ll ever have,” said Artist Thornton, the owner and “chef” (quotation marks his) of this idiosyncratic and lovely little restaurant; the food, which traverses Louisiana, Mexico and India, has an improvised feel, with dishes made for (and named after) neighbors and friends."
"Morimoto","A sparkly wonderland for glittery people, Morimoto has style, sex appeal and a sense of humor."

"Lure Fishbar","Lure Fishbar wants to add to the crudo craze but it adds too much too weirdly and too often."

"Dévi","Bewitching Devi's take on Indian food is varied, multidimensional, nimble and surprising."

"The Leopard at Des Artistes","Gianfranco Sorrentino and Paula Sorrentino transformed the old Café Des Artistes space into an airy and cheerful southern Italian clubhouse."
"Nabaya","At this West African restaurant only a few dishes are ever available, but they are worth it: by day, stews briny with smoked fish and crawfish powder; by night, large, single-minded plates of meat needled with Scotch bonnets."
"Hakata Tonton","A temple to the very strange idea that pigs’ feet are the missing ingredient in just about everything."
"Nougatine at Jean Georges","Though it rarely comes up in conversations about favorite Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurants, Nougatine has been one of the most dependable, year in and year out."

"Scarpetta","Scarpetta represents chef Scott Conant's return to the New York restaurant scene after a full year away."

"St. Anselm","A charming neighborhood restaurant devoted to the pleasures of open fire, with a pulsing bass line of ambition beneath its simple steakhouse melody."
"By Chloe","By casting veganism as effervescent pixie lifestyle rather than moral crusade, By Chloe may be stealthily recruiting more followers to the cause."

"Perry St.","At Perry St., Jean-Georges Vongerichten gives his doubters, who had grown legion, reason to believe."

"Ilili","In terms of setting, Ilili is probably the grandest excursion into Middle Eastern cooking that New York has seen."
"Ichiran","Ichiran, a Japanese ramen chain, makes one kind of soup, the opaque ivory pork broth called tonkotsu. But it presents a boggling number of choices, starting with whether to sit at a table or in one of the “flavor concentration booths.”"

"Taste of Samarkand","Don’t be dissuaded by this Uzbek restaurant’s unassuming exterior. Inside is an arbor, with dangling grapes and leaves, and a menu with plenty to please, including improbably airy samsa (meat pastries), soups exhaling dill and kebabs that are hot gulps of salt and smoke."
"Franny's","Franny's earnestness, freshness and seasonality turns a seemingly ordinary menu into a road map to pure pleasure."
"Heidelberg","A meal at Heidelberg won't spearhead a movement to bring back classic German cuisine, but it's a pleasing history lesson."

"Pongal","Vegetarian cuisine of South India is the specialty at Pongal, where the food is kosher as well."

"Baohaus","This tiny spot on the Lower East Side specializes in gua bao, a k a Taiwanese hamburgers."
"Hard Times Sundaes","At this food truck parked behind a Walgreen’s in Mill Basin, a neighborhood in southernmost Brooklyn, the meat is fresh ground chuck, not some proprietary blend of dry-aged Black Angus cuts.  For non-locals, the journey here — by subway, then bus — is long, and worth it."
"Eim Khao Mun Kai","At Eim Khao Mun Kai, the only dish on the menu is khao man gai, a sort of punkified cover version of Hainanese chicken rice."
"Yakitori Totto","Though the menu at Yakitori Totto has something to sate the craving of every meat lover, chicken is the focus."
"Crisp","A Midtown offshoot of a Tel Aviv shop, Crisp brings global fusion to the falafel, with popular if varying results."
"El Dugout","A truck that serves Venezuelan sandwiches at the edge of an Inwood parking lot."
"El Presidente","There's no better skirt steak at 4 a.m."
"Wo Hop","What New Yorkers used to know as a Chinese restaurant, serving an Americanized version of Chinese food."
"La Palapa","La Palapa, a bright and cheerful restaurant in the East Village, presents a lighter, subtler Mexican cuisine."
"Cooper's Tavern","Cooper's Tavern, close to Penn Station, handles its steaks ably."
"Ai Fiori","Turning an Italian lens on haute French cooking, Ai Fiori is a winning defense of fine dining in New York City from the chef Michael White."
"Jeffrey's Grocery","It looks like a corner market, but it’s really a restaurant, with rillettes, braised meat dishes and a wine list 35-bottles deep."
"RedFarm","The chef Joe Ng and the restaurateur Ed Schoenfeld tailored their menu of modern Chinese cuisine for a Western palate."
"Randazzo's Clam Bar","The dark, concentrated, oregano-accented tomato sauce ladled on hot or chilled lobster, fried shrimp, steamed mussels, scungilli or fried calamari is so central to Randazzo’s mission that some customers never look beyond it."
"Sarabeth's","This Sarabeth's, like its siblings, traffics in warm and fuzzy. But there are key differences."
"The Cacao Bar by MarieBelle","The setting says Paris, but the hot chocolate is pure Mesoamerican empire."
"Dhaulagiri Kitchen","Dhaulagiri Kitchen, whose name appears nowhere outside this shack of a storefront, shares a cramped, chaotic space with a chapati bakery. The disheveled setting is part of the charm."
"Bann","Bann, an offshoot of Woo Lae Oak in SoHo, wagers that the participatory theater and straightforward results of center-of-table grilling are bound to have an audience."
"Carnitas El Atoradero","Denisse Lina Chavez, the chef and owner of Carnitas El Atoradero, cooked carnitas in her bodega next door to growing crowds. Now, with a proper kitchen, she makes daily specials with traditional herbs and spices shipped by her sister from Mexico."
"Kaña","Tapas are the thing at this friendly, lively bar, where loud music is simply part of the milieu."
"Feeding Tree","The choices are slim near Yankee Stadium, which makes this bright little Jamaican restaurant especially welcome before a game."
"Krescendo","It is unclear why Krescendo’s chef, Elizabeth Falkner, and its owner, Nancy Puglisi, camouflaged the place so thoroughly, but it is much better than the neighborhood Italian joint it is trying to pass for."
"Feast","The concept behind Feast is to find the midpoint between the ever more esoteric tasting menus that have proliferated around town and the humble satisfactions of a smorgasbord."
"Swell Dive","Swell Dive unites Filipino and Tex-Mex, the heritages of the owners, Dennis Mendoza, born in Quezon City, outside Manila, and Autumn Stanford, from Austin, Texas."
"Craft","There are no shortcuts to excellence at this luxurious and expensive American restaurant that Tom Colicchio opened in spring 2001."
"San Matteo Pizza and Espresso Bar","A tiny spot with a roaring oven that produces outstanding Neapolitan pizzas and panuozzi sandwiches"
"Javelina","Javelina bills itself as New York’s “first authentic Tex-Mex restaurant""; if this is authentic, it’s a wonder that anybody in Texas ever goes out to eat."
"Dirt Candy","Since opening in the East Village in 2008, the chef Amanda Cohen has been waging war on the “eat your vegetables” mind-set."
"Coco Roco","When you come to this bright, pleasant restaurant on the fringe of Park Slope, you are in for some of the best Peruvian food in New York."
"Guy's American Kitchen & Bar","The kind of cooking Guy Fieri celebrates on television is treated with staggering disregard at his restaurant in Times Square. Even the nachos are unlovable."
"Benjamin Steak House","You can see — and taste — the resemblance to Peter Luger in Benjamin's juicy, sizzling porterhouses."
"Periyali","Some diners might find Periyali to be a bit of a yawn. I prefer to think of it as a pleasant sigh: None of the food wows, most of it quietly impresses."
"I Coppi","The room is warm and wonderful, the wine list is excellent and the food is good."
"Caracas Arepa Bar","An offshoot of the popular Brooklyn restaurant on the Rockaway Beach Boardwalk."
"Xi'an Famous Foods","With food from Western China, this chain’s fourth store has a few seats for hand-pulled noodles, soups and lamb burgers."
"China Grill","An elegant shrine to fusion food (and power people), the inventive menu offers endless opportunities for conversation."
"South Brooklyn Pizza","There is a bar at South Brooklyn Pizza, but no takeout, no slices and no delivery: just pizza margherita and chocolate chip cookies."
"M. Wells Dinette","This reprise of M. Wells, which operated in a tin-can diner for just over a year, is not open for dinner and seems to have scaled back the portions ever so slightly for daytime eating."
"Bad Saint","Bad Saint was built to make the best of its scarce square footage, not to handle the pressure of being one of Washington’s most sought-after restaurants. Now it has to do both, because the food prepared under columns of wok smoke is richly compelling no matter how many prior run-ins you’ve had with Filipino food."
"Picket Fence","If you can stand the cuteness of Picket Fence in Ditmas Park, or, better yet, delight in it, you're in for some good eating."
"Aureole","Aureole, is Charlie Palmer's big, sprawling series of rooms on the ground floor of the Bank of America building on 42nd Street."
"Fette Sau","At Fette Sau, Brooklyn’s newest barbecue peddler, there are real rewards for the inquisitive imbiber and good ribs too."
"Super Tacos Truck","At 96th Street and Broadway, Super Tacos makes tasty and cheap tacos and serves them late at night)."
"Orso","Pretty and pricey Italian in the theater district."
"Eleven Madison Park","Both the kitchen and the dining room staff try as hard as any to bring delight to the table with every course at Eleven Madison Park, and they succeed so often that only the most determinedly grumpy souls could resist."
"Mexicocina","At this small, cheerful storefront in the South Bronx, tacos on coarse handmade corn tortillas could take most of their Manhattan rivals in a fight. But it is the daily specials that demand the trek uptown."
"Gimme! Coffee","Gimme! Coffee has been counted among the city’s best coffee bars since it arrived in New York in 2003."
"Mr. Donahue’s","Mr. Donahue’s summons up a lost world of roast beef, honest-to-goodness gravy, side dishes that sit in their own wells on sectioned plates, and an atmosphere that seems unpremeditated."
"O Ya","Tim Cushman, the creative and prolific chef of O Ya in Boston and this spinoff in Kips Bay, breaks the rules of Japanese cuisine with mixed results."
"Mexicana Mama","The food at this colorful Mexican restaurant isn't very authentic. But it tastes good."
"Momofuku Ko","The new Momofuku Ko restaurant is not an experiment, but rather a statement of what fancy dining has become, in large part due to the influence of the original."
"456 Shanghai Cuisine","The setting is dropped-ceiling bland, but real pleasures await: outstanding soup dumplings, fried fish, cold noodles and stir-fries."
"Peep","Stefan Boublil was told to make Peep, a Thai restaurant, &quot;sexy.'' To him, that meant voyeurism."
"Toro","Toro’s food isn’t stagy or gimmicky; it's honest and thoughtful, but it can feel a bit lost in this space."
"Beast","Inventive not-so-small plates in Prospect Heights."
"Millesime","A restaurant devoted to the pleasures of the sea that manages to be both luxurious and humble, ambitious and rustic, all at once."
"Ichimura at Brushstroke","Ichimura at Brushstroke does not go out of its way to advertise itself. There is no sign on the street, and no door of its own; you enter it through Brushstroke."
"La Masseria","While you won't have the meal of your life at La Masseria in the theater district, most of your food will be good, and you will certainly eat plenty."
"Mughlai","Mughlai still offers tantalizing glimpses of the pleasures of Indian food."
"East Wind Snack Shop","East Wind Snack Shop is a modern homage to Chinatown’s bygone working-class coffee houses, cramped, dingy storefronts offering unlimited tea and limited food, with plastic fans stuttering above, strategically hung fly paper and a lot of (happy) yelling between tables."
"Point Brazil","A simply decorated, sunny Brazilian buffet."
"Sariling Atin","Past the shelves of egg cracklets and adobo-flavored corn nuts at Sariling Atin is a modest dining room, where food is ordered turo-turo (point-point) style, as in a cafeteria, and spooned into plastic-foam bowls."
"Tertulia","Beneath the noise at Tertulia, there's a terrific, casual Spanish restaurant that sees its roots in the cider bars of northern Spain."
"Tri Tip Grill","A steakhouse in miniature, it serves only one cut of beef, the namesake tri-tip."
"'Cesca","Cesca, on the Upper West Side, isn't the scene it once was. But there are still plenty of reasons to go."
"Stanton Social","The Stanton Social is the restaurant as playlist, a compendium of highlights with no allegiance to a single source of inspiration."
"Pokéworks","The Manhattan location of Pokéworks, specializing in Hawaiian poke, is the first in a planned nationwide chain."
"Karu Café","In this unassuming storefront, two chefs cook side by side, one from Paraguay, the other from Venezuela: harmony between otherwise quarreling nations. Venezuelan arepas, airy corn cakes barely a finger’s width thick, may share the table with Paraguayan chipas, dense, bulging curls of cassava flour and cornmeal fattened by cheese, eggs, milk and butter and tasting like gougères after a gravitational collapse. Karu means “to eat” in Guaraní, the indigenous language written into Paraguay’s Constitution as equal to Spanish, defying the legacy of the conquistadors."
"Above","A restaurant 21 floors above Times Square in the Hilton hotel."
"Pok Pok Phat Thai","You can go so long without eating good pad Thai that you forget what it is supposed to taste like. So the version at Pok Pok Phat Thai, on the Lower East Side, is confusing at first."
"Mumbai Xpress","Other places in town serve chaat, a vast genre of Indian snacks fueled by salt and tang, but perhaps none with the same range and single-minded devotion as Mumbai Xpress. The menu's vivid offerings testify to the wisdom of a culture that respects snacks, makes them by hand and gives them nuance, layers and colliding flavors."
"Narcissa","The chef John Fraser is known for his refined, thought-out vegetable tasting menus at Dovetail on the Upper West Side. His vegetable plates at Narcissa, in the Standard, East Village hotel, are more unbuttoned and generous."
"Chao Thai","The kitchen's free hand with chiles and its facility for balancing sweet, sour and salty flavors distinguish the authentic Chao Thai from its brethren in Manhattan."
"MaLa Project","All the hidden animal corners that other civilizations treasure but tend to make ours nervous appear at this modern Chinese restaurant, part of an inventory of some sixty-odd potential ingredients for Sichuan dry pot. Four levels of “spiciness” are on offer; even a veteran fire-eater needn’t go past three."
"Schaller’s Stube","The sausages at this annex to Schaller & Weber make a mockery of the buns meant to contain them."
"Cariño","A genial place to spend an evening, its version of Mexican food reliable, if a trifle subdued."
"Achilles Heel","Long abandoned, this waterfront bar has been revived and its mission expanded to included a short, highly changeable menu of wine-bar food and slightly more."
"Yun Nan Flavour Garden","Yun Nan Flavour Garden, formerly Yun Nan Flavour Snack, features the hard-to-find crossing-the bridge-noodles alongside its greatest hits: perfect dumplings, lucid soups and house-made rice noodles with bounce and bite."
"Testaccio","Testaccio brings a Roman menu (at friendly prices) to Long Island City’s Restaurant Row."
"Giovanni Rana Pastificio & Cucina","Giovanni Rana Pastificio & Cucina brings fresh pasta dishes to Chelsea Market."
"Rebelle","In French, the name means rebel. The implied assault on tradition may be fairly tame stuff, but you bump into it all over the restaurant. The unforced, modern, intermittently French food is inspired by the loosely bound bistronomy movement. All the wines come from France and the United States, and many are made in the contemporary, hands-off style."
"Burgers Bar","One of two New York outposts of an Israeli chain (the other is in Cedarhurst, on Long Island)."
"Moldova","At Moldova, devoted to the cooking of the small former Soviet republic, you might feel as if you’d crashed a wedding and been immediately made welcome."
"Onya Japanese Restaurant","Order, slurp and be back at your desk before your computer automatically checks for new e-mail."
"Aburiya Kinnosuke","At Aburiya Kinnosuke, you'll get an adventure, and an often delicious one at that."
"Tom's Restaurant","Tom's, the diner whose facade was immortalized on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; offers just what you'd expect."
"Lavagna","The food is fresh and generous, with honest, straightforward flavors."
"Five Leaves","Five Leaves in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, serves simple Australian food with a bit of flair and modest prices."
"Mighty Quinn's Barbeque","Mighty Quinn’s, which slow-cooks high-quality meats using only wood, comes as close to delivering on all fronts as any barbecue place in the city."
"Pera Soho","The Mediterranean small plate puts on downtown garb, becoming more fanciful (and flagrantly expensive)."
"Soul Fixins'","Soul Fixins' Southern food makes for good takeout."
"David's Brisket House","For decades, this Brooklyn classic has been turning out the sassiest pastrami, sultriest brisket and lean, mean corned beef sandwiches."
"Bar Veloce","While the menu includes supplements like a salad and a cheese platter, Bar Veloce's focus is strictly on sandwiches and wine, and Godard."
"Biricchino","Sausages and charcuterie are the draw at this pleasant, plain little Italian place near Madison Square Garden."
"Grand Sichuan Eastern","The classics of the Grand Sichuan chain are still classic and the new dishes include some truly unexpected combinations."
"Hakubai","The food feeds your curiosity more than your hunger: It is rarefied and supremely Japanese."
"Cafe 2 and Terrace 5","No museum visitor can feel anything but considerable cheer about these two options at MoMA and hail them as a happy commingling of art and appetite."
"Marc Forgione","Marc Forgione is rustic and urban at once, a loft that might be in a Hudson River mill town."
"12 Chairs","It offers Middle Eastern dishes, American sandwiches, omelets and pancakes, as well as simple Russian dishes like fine blini."
"Cafe Luxembourg","Too crowded and too noisy, but if you're looking for a bistro near Lincoln Center, this is the place."
"Casa Mono","Anthony Sasso, the chef de cuisine, has led the Casa Mono kitchen into cooking that a Catalan tapas-bar proprietor might squint at before deciding that tapas do not always need to be interpreted with a strict-constructionist approach."
"Djerdan Burek","Djerdan feels like a jewel, with food cheap enough that you can say you got it wholesale."
"Spice Market","Spice Market still boasts a classier look than many restaurants of its ilk, but the cooking has turned somewhat sloppy since its opening in 2004."
"Goa Taco","Goa Taco's offerings are half-moon in shape, but in lieu of a thin, pliant tortilla, fillings — Chinese five-spice duck confit, say, or Oaxacan-style achiote lamb with Greek tzatziki — are trapped inside paratha, a many-layered Indian flatbread built like a chapbook of dough, each leaf inscribed with ghee."
"The Musket Room","At the Musket Room, Matt Lambert, a native of Auckland, prepares New Zealand food that is ambitious and meticulously detailed."
"Uva","Uva, the offspring of Lusardi's, seems like an Upper East Side wild child."
"The Shanty","The public face of the New York Distilling Company features exemplary cocktails in a comfortable, if slightly anonymous, setting."
"Oceana","Those who order carefully at Oceana — the raw bar, followed by whole fish or simple preparations — will partake of fabulous meals."
"Cosme","The first New York restaurant from the acclaimed Mexican chef Enrique Olvera pulls off two tough moves at once. First, its approach to Mexican cuisine is modern and relaxed, but without the superficiality that might imply. Second, it has a sharp instinct for what New Yorkers want when they go out for dinner, which isn’t often the case with restaurants opened by chefs from abroad."
"Tir Na Nog","Irish cuisine, beyond corned beef and cabbage."
"Gottscheer Hall Tap Room","The taproom at this German social hall serves comfort food with an old-country accent."
"Brasserie","The all-new Brasserie is a clamorous, happy place."
"Sons of Thunder","Sons of Thunder serves what may be the best Hawaiian poke in town."
"Dumpling Galaxy","Sturdy, knobby, domestic creatures in the Northern Chinese tradition, Helen You's dumplings are stuffed to order, and she fine-tunes them with the sensitivity of a natural cook who really listens to her ingredients. At Dumpling Galaxy, she offers 100 varieties, along with an additional menu of dishes from Hunan, Dongbei and Fujian."
"Nanoosh","Nanoosh calls itself a &quot;Mediterranean Hummus Bar&quot; and promotes its organic ingredients but has the prefab look of a franchise."
"DBGB Kitchen and Bar","Daniel Boulud tries downtown on for size with a casually elegant sausage and burger bar that offers great French pleasures alongside the ground meat."
"Papa's Kitchen","At Papa’s Kitchen, Beth Roa, co-owner, waitress and M.C., makes the rounds of tables, gently proffering a karaoke microphone, while in the kitchen her brother, Miguel, cooks serious Filipino comfort food."
"Ricos Tacos","The tortas at Ricos Tacos are the best of their breed in Sunset Park."
"House of Inasal","This Filipino restaurant, in a stretch of Queens known as Little Manila, feels spacious and sleepy, operating at the pace of a desultory ceiling fan. The menu is congenial, offering unlimited rice, all-day breakfast and street specialties like grilled pork intestines and kwek-kwek (deep-fried quail eggs)."
"Lao Dong Bei","Lao Dong Bei specializes in the cuisine of the Dongbei region of northeast China (formerly known as Manchuria), which is still relatively new to our shores, and hasn’t yet entered into a dialogue with, or succumbed to, the American palate."
"Yerba Buena","This tiny pan-Latin spot in the East Village has the swagger, service and potted palms of a restaurant three times its size."
"Casa Del Chef","Casa Del Chef's food — the kind of thoughtful farm-to-table cooking now standard in other parts of the city but still a rarity in this neighborhood — is rooted in the country its chef and owner, Alfonso Zhicay, now calls home."
"Sake Bar Hagi","The contrast between the caustically corporate after-work haunts in Times Square and the sake-buzzed looseness at Sake Bar Hagi, a subterranean izakaya, is one of its biggest charms."
"Da Nico","One of the few Italian restaurants in Little Italy that is actually worth trying."
"Harry's Cafe and Steak","Like today's other newfangled steakhouses, Harry's simultaneously buys into and bucks the traditional formula, with muddled results."
"Blue Collar","Blue Collar is a sunny counter-service-only spot, with red chairs and round white tables anchored by bottles of ketchup and mustard. Burgers, built in the In-N-Out Californian style, start at $4, single and unadorned, and top out at $6.25 for a double with cheese, which is the one you want."
"Crema","Imaginative flourishes or intricate architecture define many of Julieta Ballesteros's dishes, but the kitchen's execution doesn't always live up to the recipes."
"Nitehawk Cinema","Saul Bolton made over the movie-theater usuals and added satisfying comfort dishes and desserts to enjoy while taking in a film."
"The Standard Grill","With 200 seats indoors and another 85 on the sidewalk, it is a marvel that the kitchen reliably bangs out solid, flavorful food that casually integrates Spanish ingredients with French and Italian ideas."
"Crave","When it's frigid and difficult outside, you want something warm and cozy; Crave in Brooklyn fits the bill."
"Yunnan Kitchen","A sleek package of glass and exposed brick on an unreconstructed block of the Lower East Side, Yunnan Kitchen takes a farmer’s market approach to the cuisine of Yunnan Province."
"Pampano","Against a clean backdrop, Pampano's chef, Richard Sandoval, delivers inventive, sharply executed seafood dishes that keep the taste buds busy."
"Minetta Tavern","In freshening up Minetta Tavern, Keith McNally did as expected, figuring out what to buff and what to leave be. But he did something unexpected as well: he fashioned the best steakhouse in the city."
"La Sirène","This minimally decorated, cramped 25-seater by the Holland Tunnel provides a warm change of pace from the vacuous polish and higher prices of better-known establishments."
"Indian Road Cafe","Wandering into Indian Road Cafe is like discovering a secret hideaway. In the culinary tug-of-war between innovation and familiarity, the chef Nicholas Wright-Bodine pulls tenaciously for Team Comfort."
"Esperanto","A warm and welcoming place with Latin food that can be surprisingly subtle."
"Blueprint","An artisanal cocktail bar that serves charcuterie and cheeses, seasonally driven salads, small plates and bigger dishes."
"Maialino","Danny Meyer's trattoria is a Roman holiday in the center of Manhattan."
"Wildair","The chefs Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske serve familiar, likeable food at this wine bar two doors down Orchard Street from their showcase restaurant, Contra."
"Morgan Dining Room","The new restaurant at the Morgan Library and Museum teaches the eternal pleasures of capitalism: marble fireplaces, heavy silver, and really rich cream sauces."
"Empellón Taqueria","It can be fearsomely loud in Alex Stupak’s brave Mexican restaurant, but one bite of the restaurant’s cloudlike chicharrón with roasted tomato and olive salsa may keep you from running out the door."
"Blenheim","A tremendous amount of thought and effort has gone into Blenheim’s food, drinks and design, but the pieces don’t always fit together. When tables are set up outside next to the cobblestoned streets, Blenheim looks as if its only desire is to be your drop-in-and-hang-out corner tavern. But the food, as imagined by the chef Ryan Tate, has as much business in a rusticated farm-to-table tavern as white tie and spats."
"Butcher Bar","A butcher shop and a restaurant, meats can be taken home to your kitchen or served on the spot."
"The Bao","At this Manhattan outpost of Kung Fu Xiao Long Bao, in Flushing, Queens,  the menu is greatest-hits Chinese, corralling Sichuan flamethrowers with old-school Cantonese."
"Dawa’s","Dawa Bhuti, a young immigrant of Tibetan descent, cooks alongside her father, Ngodup Gyaltsen. The front side of the menu, devoted to brunch dishes of almost Californian lightness, is hers; the thrill is the hidden tracks, listed on the back as “ethnic plates” — Mr. Gyaltsen’s contribution from the hometown he had to leave behind."
"M & T Restaurant","The cuisine of Qingdao is prepared with elegant simplicity at this small Flushing restaurant."
"Punda Tibetan","Punda Tibetan's menu, with just three dishes over $10, is nomadic in spirit, but the best dishes — momos (dumplings), soups of remarkable clarity, beef sautés of alternating brightness and heat — are the ones identified as Tibetan."
"Costata","Michael White returns to the address in SoHo where he made his name, when it was called Fiamma. Now he is an owner and the restaurant is a steakhouse, and the bone-in rib-eye for two, called the Costata, is a reason for this restaurant to exist all by itself."
"Barchetta","There are encouraging nights when Barchetta seems like the ideal downtown seafood restaurant for people who really love the taste of fish. But when the kitchen loses its rhythm, Barchetta can seem mired among all the also-rans."
"Artichoke Basille's Pizza & Brewery","Artichoke Basille's makes an underrepresented style of pizza — big pies on a bready crust, generously and greasily topped — and the city has gone nuts for it."
"Seasonal","What was a fairly bland room has been redecorated and now combines hardwoods and forest green leather chairs so it more closely resembles the East Village wine bars owned by Eduard Frauneder and Wolfgang Ban."
"Oda House","Oda House, on a subdued corner of Alphabet City, may be the first restaurant in Manhattan to capture the inclusive and at times shambolic spirit of Georgian restaurants in southern Brooklyn."
"Food Shing","The fresh noodles, the soup and the prices at Food Shing are good enough to keep you coming back for more."
"El Toro Blanco","Once you plow through the crowds struggling in vain to catch a bartender’s eye at El Toro Blanco, you emerge into a dining room that might be in Santa Barbara during the last days of the Nixon administration."
"Nicoletta","Nicoletta’s pizzas are not quite deep dish, but they are heading in that direction. The crust is as strong as epoxy, and are piled up with an abundance of toppings that would buckle an ordinary pie."
"El Rey Coffee Bar and Luncheonette","Gerardo Gonzalez has has worked out a point of view in the El Rey kitchen that is distinctly his own, a blend of California-Mexican cuisine with some of the less punitive flavors from the health-food and vegan disciplines."
"Blaue Gans","As dashed-off as Kurt Gutenbrunner's Blaue Gans may seem to be, it proves that a restaurant needn't be tremendously significant to be significantly appealing."
"Kyo Ya","A Japanese hideaway in the middle of the East Village, known for its kaiseki dining."
"Turkish Kitchen","Wonderful Turkish food in a seductive setting."
"Kittichai","At Kittichai, a Thai restaurant with infinite visual pleasures, a few dishes do not work, but many more do."
"Ninja New York","Ninja New York is nonsensical, and its climactic illusion may well be a disappearing act."
"Miss Maude's Spoonbread Too","Miss Maude's Spoonbread Too, a bright, inviting restaurant in Harlem, celebrates family meals without the nostalgia implicit in expressions like 'comfort food.'"
"Chayhana Salom","The charming dining room is clean and bright behind a slightly grubby storefront. Food is served on formal china with glimmers of gilt."
"Ivan Ramen","Ivan Orkin, the Long Island-born chef who made his name cooking ramen in Tokyo, comes home with a restaurant that shows his breadth as a chef."
"Village Yokocho","A crowded Japanese spot hiding in plain sight, this is the place you walk through to get to the bar Angel's Share."
"La Sirena","La Sirena has two dining rooms connected by a bar with the approximate dimensions of a jet runway. It's so large that somebody is always on the move. That perpetual motion supplies a lot of La Sirena’s energy; the rest comes from the dressy trattoria cooking."
"Molyvos","Informal and friendly, Molyvos has a thoroughgoing Greek appeal."
"Zing’s Awesome Rice","Raw grains are steeped in olive oil and mysterious seasonings, then steamed, baked and seared in a heavy pan instead of a wok, with more olive oil, a “secret” sauce and ingredients cooked separately before being tossed together at this takeout shop on the Lower East Side."
"Junoon","A dream-state Del Posto, the sort of restaurant where of course you would order a ValpolicellaGrassi with your monkfish tikka."
"Violet’s Bake Shoppe","At this Chinese bakery with a sideline in Vietnamese banh mi, the ratios — of bread to charcuterie (almost all made in-house) to pickles to condiments — are golden. The bread is a cloud in crisp armor, with a crust that snaps like kindling, and then the sandwich is all creaminess, salt and heat, deeply basal flavors and brisk, bright ones, every note seemingly struck at once."
"Burmese Bites","For nearly two decades, the only place to find Myo Lin Thway’s palata (also known, more poetically, as hundred-layer bread) was at a once-a-year church fair. But now, at Burmese Bites on Saturdays at the Queens International Night Market, he serves three dishes, at $5 each; they make you wish he cooked every night, year-round."
"Golden Palace","Modest but tasty, with home-style cooking from China's Northeast region."
"Los Tacos No. 1","Hatched by three entrepreneurial gents from the West (two from California, one from northern Mexico), Los Tacos No. 1 is more or less engineered to serve as an oasis for all those West Coast transplants who are constantly complaining about the dubious quality of tacos in New York City."
"Cafe Istanbul","Cafe Istanbul specializes in lahmacuns and cantiks, dishes in which various meats and vegetables are placed pizza-like atop dough and baked until crisp in the center and puffy around the edges."
"Nobu Next Door","It doesn't accept reservations so you can stroll in and take a number for a seat at the sushi bar."
"Casa Enrique","Cosme Aguilar, the chef of Casa Enrique, brings polish to Mexican classics without tampering with their essence."
"Marta","Pizza, a lesser stop on Rome’s culinary pilgrimage route, is the main event of this pizzeria, opened by the chef Nick Anderer. Marta has Roman appetizers and entire Roman dishes repurposed as toppings for pizzas with thin crusts in the Roman style. Main courses are available, but they are not as trustworthy as the pies."
"Biang!","Biang! is a collaboration between David Shi and his son, Jason Wang, both natives of the ancient imperial city of Xi’an in central China. The merged sensibilities result in a place where Chinese grandparents can sit down next to young people who may not know the original recipes but can recognize great flavors and a very good deal when they see them."
"Kang Suh Restaurant","Two things make this special: it's open 24 hours and you grill your own food at the table."
"Ni Japanese Delicacies","A cluttered stall without tables or chairs in the Essex Street Market offering exquisite dishes."
"Allswell","The best of Nate Smith's cooking shows real sensitivity to ingredients, with a few British touches he picked up during his time at the Spotted Pig."
"Degustation Wine & Tasting Bar","One of the many progeny of Jewel Bako, Degustation works, primarily because most of the modestly portioned dishes, which use Spanish new wave flourishes, are terrific."
"Flinders Lane","There’s a genial ambiculturalism at play at this modern Australian restaurant, which shows clear affection for English tradition while reaching across the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea for more fervent flavors."
"The Peacock","The William, a boutique hotel, offers two upholstered cocktail lounges and two distinct places to eat reformed English cooking. Upstairs is the Peacock, a civilized, grown-up restaurant."
"Tavern on the Green","Compared with its last days before its death of insolvency in 2009 made it the subject of countless dry-eyed eulogies, Tavern on the Green is much, much improved."
"Keens Steakhouse","A meaty Mecca since 1885, Keens Steakhouse continues to provide carnivores a cause for rejoicing."
"Socarrat","Churros are the supermodels of the doughnut world: long, skinny and vaguely extraterrestrial. At La Churreria, they are moist inside yet dry to the touch, crisp and fluffy and chewy all at once; dunk them in the accompanying hot chocolate, which is served in a coffee cup and so dark and thick it almost counts as a pudding."
"Anella","An intimate little art house of a restaurant in Greenpoint, with a menu of simple, seasonally appropriate food."
"Amaranth","Another casual, expensive bistro."
"Robert's Steakhouse","No matter what your appetite for the saucy spectacle accessorizing the steaks at Robert's Steakhouse in the Penthouse Executive Club, you’ll be turned on by the quality of the plated meat."
"Sushi Dojo","High-sheen, poppy neo-disco sets the tone, but the soul of the party is sushi worth getting crazy about."
"O Mai","O Mai, a heavily stylized place that serves traditional, delicate Vietnamese fare, really is the sort of place to cause exclamation."
"Nick and Toni's Cafe","A great neighborhood place on the Upper West Side."
"Patacon Pisao","The specialty here is patacón, the formidable sandwich of the city of Maracaibo, Venezuela, bookended not by bread but by unripe plantains that have been fried, smashed and fried again. The small but sleek storefront traces its origins back to 2005, when Liliana Velazquez, a native of Maracaibo, started selling patacónes out of a truck in Inwood, Manhattan"
"Fort Defiance","In a part of Red Hook that feels like a sleepy Maine port, Fort Defiance is part bar, part restaurant and part serious coffee joint."
"Mimi’s Hummus","The best hummus in town may be found at Mimi Kitani’s namesake restaurant in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, which now has an outpost in the East Village. The rest of the focused, unfussy menu draws from the Jerusalem-born chef’s Moroccan and Iraqi heritage, including a verdant lentil stew musky with black limes and rosewater-scented milk pudding."
"Kabab Cafe","The minty, spicy aroma alone is reason enough to visit the tiny Kabab Cafe."
"Trestle on Tenth","The wine list at Trestle on Tenth favors small over large producers, spirited over lulling wines, adventure over surefire accessibility."
"The Steakhouse at Fairway","Fairway, the supermarket, has come up with something new: a steakhouse grafted onto a grocery store. The kitchen is more than competent."
"Rosanjin","The delicacy of the food and the precise rhythms of its presentation have the soothing effect of meditation at the kaiseki restaurant Rosanjin in TriBeCa."
"Alison Eighteen","Alison Price Becker’s return to Manhattan is a place where civilized adults can have an appetizer and an entree, in that order, and where the kitchen isn’t going to try any funny stuff."
"Bistro Vendôme","Bistro Vendôme grafts an Upper East Side service ethos onto an undemanding French menu."
"Southern Hospitality","The most confounding thing about Southern Hospitality, Justin Timberlake’s new restaurant, is those baby back ribs. Because they are, against tall odds, good."
"Pho Grand","Timing is not Pho Grand's specialty, but the fare includes some fabulous combinations."
"Bar Room at the Modern","The bar area of the restaurant the Modern may not have the dining room's sculpture-garden view, but it does have a more accessible, straightforward menu of dishes so satisfying that the trade-off is worth it."
"The General Greene","Nicholas Morgenstern goes beyond dessert with updated diner-style comfort foods on small plates."
"Da Ciro","An excellent, often overlooked little Italian restaurant."
"Tenpenny","A good restaurant in a boring Chotchkie’s-like room in the narrow, undistinguished lobby of the Gotham Hotel."
"Maison Premiere","When Maison Premiere first opened in Williamsburg, it was primarily a bar, serving little more than absinthe and oysters. But now a proper kitchen has been built in the basement and the menu expanded."
"La Colombe Torrefaction","A Philadelphia company known for its darker roasts."
"Kutsher's Tribeca","Opened by a member of the family that owns a legendary, if faded, resort in the Catskills, Kutsher’s Tribeca turns all the old jokes about Jewish cooking upside-down."
"Moti Mahal Delux","Heavily influenced by the Persian cuisine that was brought to the subcontinent by the Mogul emperors, the cooking of North India still has an imperial lavishness when cooked with care and consideration for ingredients, as it is at Moti Mahal Delux."
"Lincoln Ristorante","A large and glittery Italian restaurant under a swooping grass roof on the campus of Lincoln Center, run under the direction of the chef Jonathan Benno."
"Inakaya","This Japanese restaurant specializes in robata, or grill cooking, done at the central counter"
"El Cocotero","Venezuelan cooking in a full-service setting, with beer, wine and sangria."
"Stone Park Cafe","The menu at Stone Park Cafe in Park Slope establishes a personality of sophisticated robustness while accommodating many predilections and moods."
"Mimi's Hummus","This sunny Ditmas Park cafe serves flavors that bear traces of the chef's family history in Israel, Morocco and the Kurdish region of Iraq."
"Maloney & Porcelli","A theme park restaurant for lawyers and investment bankers."
"Prune","It is easy to see why Prune is so widely and fervently loved. It listens to its own muse and operates by a credo of whimsical indulgence."
"Bali Nusa Indah","A skip and jump from the theater district, Bali Nusa Indah is the ambiance king of Indonesian restaurants in the city, offering fresh and lively dishes in a pleasant setting."
"Raoul's","A Prince Street mainstay since the mid 1970s, Raoul’s is a taste of the Manhattan found in Sondheim lyrics."
"Gradisca","Gradisca epitomizes the local trattoria, downtown style."
"The Chinese Club","The Chinese Club looks like a straightforwardly (if self-consciously kitschy) Chinese restaurant. But the food is as Chinese as General Tso’s chicken — diaspora cuisine, filtered through another nation’s consciousness, in this case India’s."
"Cassia","One of the most appealing things about Cassia is its pointed lack of interest in being confrontational. The restaurant goes out of its way to be accommodating, without doing too much violence to the various Asian cuisines (Vietnamese in particular) that inspire much of the menu."
"Masa","The food at this excellent Japanese restaurant in the Time Warner Center is exceptional, offering tastes and preparations that can be unforgettable."
"Macao Trading Company","Macao Trading Co. serves not-quite-Portuguese-Chinese-fusion cooking on two levels: an upstairs devoted principally to dining and a more whimsical lounge where the focus is cocktails."
"Lima's Taste","A good deal of the food at Lima's Taste is delicious. Despite the smoke and mirrors, sometimes that's what you want most from a meal."
"Tsion Cafe","Beejhy Barhany, the chef, was born in northern Ethiopia into a community of Beta Israel, as Ethiopian Jews are known. Her menu can read like a biography: eggs scrambled with lox over injera, the sour, springy Ethiopian flatbread perforated like coral; challah French toast spiked with awaze, a meld of earthy-hot berbere and tej, Ethiopian honey wine."
"Wisefish Poké","Wisefish Poké presents raw fish Hawaiian-style, anointed with various sauces and toppings."
"Wafa's","Appealingly fresh food prepared by Lebanon-born chef and owner Wafa Chami"
"Half King","One thing sets the Half King apart from most writers' bars: food that you can actually enjoy."
"Cavo","Cavo combines two mainstays of Astoria, Queens — Greek restaurants and sidewalk cafes — in a setting straight out of Club Med."
"Bâtard","There are high spirits in Bâtard’s dining room, which hums, and at times roars, with the sound of people having a fine night on the town."
"Brick Lane Curry House","The food at Brick Lane Curry House is powerfully spiced, distinctively flavored, extremely fresh."
"Duane Park","This restaurant and nightclub, which closed in TriBeCa in February, has reopened on the Bowery."
"Speedy Romeo","At this artisanal pizzeria on the border of Bedford-Stuyvesant, the pies are of the thin-crust variety, fired in a wood-burning oven."
"Soto","Soto is a showcase for impressive culinary artistry in roughly 30 dishes that combine lovely fish and vibrant seasonings in distinctive ways."
"Cafeteria at the Metropolitan Museum of Art","The renovated cafeteria strikes a bright, modern note, and the eclectic menu, an exercise in high-end populism, seems appropriate for a self-service operation."
"Huertas","Huertas is really two restaurants and two experiences under one roof. In the back is a small, square dining room where the chef, Jonah Miller, serves a set menu of five courses. In the front of the restaurant is an inviting tapas bar, where a different style of eating unfolds."
"El Quinto Pino","A short “menu turistico” investigates a different region of the country every few months and the thirty seats in the dining room feel romantic, but not in an obvious way. It’s a room meant for talking."
"Bruno","Bruno’s chefs, Justin Slojkowski and Dave Gulino, mill the flour for their pizza dough in the basement, and serve pies that don't play it safe."
"The National Bar and Dining Rooms","A lively and comfortable neighborhood bistro in the lobby of the Benjamin Hotel, with a smart, accessible and not terribly expensive menu by the celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian."
"Dirty French","What if nouvelle cuisine had embraced maximalism instead of minimalism, full-frontal abandon instead of lean precision? The result might be something like Dirty French, where the chefs Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone treat the food of France with a hugely energizing lack of respect."
"Sookk","Interesting if unsteady food makes Sookk an exception to the increasingly charmless Thai restaurants of Manhattan."
"John Brown Smokehouse","True Midwestern barbecue in Queens."
"Jollibee","Jollibee is a Filipino fast-food chain, with 600-plus outlets there, across Asia and on our own West Coast."
"Crown","A luxe town house restaurant by John DeLucie of the Lion in Greenwich Village."
"Earl's Beer and Cheese","It’s comically tiny and always packed, and it doesn’t look much like a bar, but Earl’s has charm in spades."
"Cachapas y Mas","A narrow storefront that serves Venezuelan cooking like roast pork sandwiches made with fried plantains."
"Chimichurri Grill","This menu will make any carnivore smile."
"Chuko","The unexpected stars of the menu at this 35-seat ramen shop are the vegetables, lusty and infused with swagger."
"Wilfie & Nell","The food at Wilfie & Nell, named for the grandparents of brothers Mark and Simon Gibson, is resolutely pub fare."
"Di Fara Pizza","In Midwood, Brooklyn, one holdout stands solidly against the tide against pizza by the slice."
"Little Morocco","This breezy cafe in Astoria, Queens, has an exceptional merguez sandwich."
"Bati","Bati serves traditional Ethiopian food in an environment that has a slightly improvised air."
"Rosemary's","There are reasons Rosemary’s waiting list has been oversubscribed since its opening. First among them is the spirited cooking of Wade Moises, who learned to move gracefully around a scalding pot of spaghetti at Mario Batali’s finishing school."
"Traif","Thoughtful cooking with subtle and complex flavors on the border of Hasidic Williamsburg and hipsterville."
"Ápizz","Frank DeCarlo and John LaFemina, who own Peasant, on Elizabeth Street, now have a second wood-fueled restaurant: Ápizz, has an immense brick oven."
"Silver Moon Bakery","Silver Moon Bakery, a small shop at 2740 Broadway, has enough variety to fill the baskets of fresh-bread-starved Upper West Siders."
"Avra","Fresh fish, barely touched, is the selling point here. It's an appealing formula, to which Avra brings its own brand of charm."
"Shopsin’s General Store","A reincarnation, in the Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side, of the fabled West Village restaurant. It includes many of the old restaurant’s countless quirks, including a sprawling menu."
"Bistro Ten 18","The problem with Bistro Ten 18 is that it wants to be more than a neighborhood restaurant."
"Thelewala","Unlike other late-night joints, the fare is made to order, Indian street food at its brightest and freshest."
"Timna","Timna’s chef, Nir Mesika, grew up in Israel, and his cooking is at its strongest when he draws from memory, as with kubaneh, a Yemenite-Jewish bread somewhere between brioche and challah, or a simple dish of vegetables and farro laced with raw tahini and date molasses."
"Uncle Nick's Greek Cuisine","Once a little hole in the wall in Clinton, Uncle Nick's has expanded a handsome Greek taverna."
"Nusara","Nusara belongs on the short but growing list of reliably good Thai restaurants in Queens."
"Community Food and Juice","Though its name conveys all the allure of a food bank, Community Food and Juice is the most welcoming restaurant to appear on the Upper West Side in years."
"Aquagrill","SoHo's very own seafood emporium is like a particularly hip mom-and-pop place."
"Safari","At Safari, there are fine heaps of meat, underscored by African birdseye chiles; influences from across the gulf and the Arabian Sea; and turmeric-tinged rice nestled companionably beside pasta in a quasi-Alfredo sauce of coconut and cow’s milks, imbued with oregano, rosemary and basil — a legacy of Somalia’s half-century of Italian occupation."
"Cafe ""At Your Mother-in-Law""","Serves an amalgam of Eastern European, Korean and Uzbek cuisines in a sunny space in the heart of Little Odessa."
"SakaMai","SakaMai is a Japanese restaurant filtered through an American consciousness, respectful of tradition but not bound by it."
"Extra Virgin","Extra Virgin, a creation of the chef Joey Fortunato, is a little gem of a restaurant."
"The Library at the Public","There is nothing glib about the food at The Library at the Public, a crepuscular attic of a restaurant chiseled from the upper recesses of the lobby at the Public Theater."
"Podunk","The ineffably charming Podunk, in the East Village, is a self-styled &quot;American tearoom.&quot;"
"Freek’s Mill","Freek’s Mill looks not very different from other young, ingredient-minded Brooklyn restaurants. But the wine list is wonderfully eccentric, heavily weighted with chenin blanc and gamay. These wines are flexible, wrapping themselves around whatever you happen to be eating. This is lucky, because so many things on Chad Shaner’s menu are worth trying."
"Han Joo","Han Joo offers barbecue by way of the spa, each tabletop grill an infrared sauna in miniature, the pulse of heat from the crystal cooking everything to eerie evenness."
"Blue Ribbon Sushi Izakaya","The strains of empire are apparent at Blue Ribbon Sushi Izakaya, the latest addition to Eric and Bruce Bromberg’s ever-expanding Blue Ribbon portfolio."
"Gari","Gari offers artfully prepared and fresh sushi; the only issue may be the cost."
"Korzo","This gastro-bar in Brooklyn serves Mittel-European comfort food in what might be called recession-era portions."
"Lucy’s Vietnamese Kitchen","At Lucy’s Vietnamese Kitchen, pho chay has a bold near-funk from long-simmering shiitake mushrooms, charred shallots, ginger and a suffusion of spices, and while the broth, as crystalline as consommé, is lovely in its pristine state, it is even better besmirched by brisket that has been smoked for 14 hours."
"Awash","Awash, a small but crowded restaurant on Amsterdam Avenue near 106th Street, excels at both vegetarian dishes and at kitfo, a raw beef delicacy invariably referred to as Ethiopian steak tartare."
"The Beagle","First-rate food and mixed drinks together become something less than the sum of the parts."
"Le Zie","Appropriately for a Venetian spot, much of the food suggests the sea."
"E.A.T.","Looks like a coffee shop, costs like caviar."
"McSorley's Old Ale House","The limited menu of burgers and sandwiches does little but pad the stomach for more beer."
"First Avenue Pierogi and Deli Co.","Excellent Polish and Ukrainian takeout, like delicate pierogi, half-moon dumplings with stuffings like potato or carrot and mushroom."
"Le Relais de Venise L’Entrecôte","Cheerful bistro setting offers paintings of Venetian scenes; good flowers; candlelight."
"Thursday Kitchen","Thursday Kitchen has more interesting cooking than you might expect from a restaurant that serves illuminated cocktails in plastic bags, like debauched Capri Suns. Kyungmin Kay Hyun, the chef, a native of South Korea, ferments her own ponzu for 30 days to accompany her exemplary pajeon (scallion pancake); pairs charred octopus with a chardonnay gelée and a Korean barbecue-like tincture of soy, scallions and Asian pear; and tempers crispy pork belly with white kimchi, so called because it’s made without chile, privileging funk over heat."
"Bar Boulud","Daniel Boulud has made Bar Boulud, which opened at the start of 2008, a place where many of the seats are at a long counter, walk-in business is encouraged and the star attractions are the fantastic charcuterie selections and a terrific wine list."
"Sasabune","Sasabune exemplifies a certain kind of sushi restaurant and experience: the unadorned, serene refuge where diners submit to an omakase menu and to a chef with firm, largely unwavering ideas."
"Mission Cantina","Mission Cantina, Danny Bowien's nonconformist Mexican restaurant, charges under $10 for almost everything on the menu. For those prices, you don’t grumble too loudly when a dish fizzles."
"Brasserie 8 1/2","Signs of over achievement are everywhere on the menu, and it is easy to understand why. The food has to go a long, long way to take anyone's mind off the design."
"Sushi Azabu","Sushi Azabu stands out in a crowded sushi marketplace on account of its sublime setting."
"Barbounia","Most of the food at Barbounia is appealing without rising to the level of exciting."
"Tulsi","The chef Hemant Mathur's glittering Midtown redoubt of Indian cooking."
"Mayfield","Mayfield is broadly American in mission, with an occasional Southern twang."
"Fish Cheeks","Specializing in a small number of seafood dishes from around Thailand, Fish Cheeks is not a groundbreaking experiment; it simply cooks the way more Thai kitchens should."
"Tong Sam Gyup Goo Yi","At this barbecue restaurant, the gleaming black grill plate on each table mimics the lid of a traditional Korean cauldron, allowing the pork belly’s drippings to run down into the wreath of bean sprouts, kimchi and garlic cloves snapping on the hot iron below."
"Momofuku Noodle Bar","Momofuku Noodle Bar occupies the realm of deeply personal restaurants defined by one person's vision and drive — in this case, of David Chang."
"Bowery Meat Company","The chef Josh Capon and the restaurateur John McDonald, the pair behind Lure Fishbar and El Toro Blanco, have brought forth a “meat company” whose website says it is “not a traditional steakhouse, but a balanced meat-centric menu.” Bowery Meat Company is not, in fact, a menu. But it does have a menu, and on it you will find seven cuts of beef plus a burger, potatoes cooked four ways, and a spinach side dish."
"Kafana","Kafana serves Serbian food to expatriates and East Village residents."
"Atera","In the open kitchen at this intimate tasting room, Matthew Lightner is matching foraged ingredients together with technical sleight of hand to summon up moments of genuine beauty."
"Angon on the Sixth","Angon is proof that interesting, authentic Indian cooking is not relegated to the outer reaches of New York City."
"Columbine","Friendly farmhouse-style takeout shop specializes in sandwiches that go beyond traditional combinations, while avoiding the excesses of many designer sandwiches."
"Buon Italia","This is not complicated food, but it is delicious."
"Rusty Mackerel","At this narrow, cheerful restaurant in the quiet northwestern corner of Washington Heights, the flavors are mainly Mediterranean, with the occasional high-concept dish, like a burger that’s a cross between a Dominican chimi and a British butty. The chef and owner, James Moran, grew up in the neighborhood. His first job was as a delivery boy for Frank’s Market, around the corner; the owners, who gave him his nickname, Mac, are now his business partners."
"Gargiulo's","This large Coney Island Italian restaurant is more than a century old."
"Tuome","You have probably eaten in dozens of rooms like Tuome in the past few years, and eaten dishes that look like the ones that the chef, Thomas Chen, is sending from the kitchen. Once the meal begins, though, it becomes clear that Mr. Chen has originality to spare and a clear, fresh point of view, particularly when he interprets Chinese cuisine."
"Ben & Jack's Steak House","It's unfortunate that the food at Ben & Jack's strives to mimic Peter Luger's, rather than to aim higher."
"Vinegar Hill House","Vinegar Hill House, in Brooklyn, is warm and welcoming."
"Legend Bar and Restaurant","At this spiffed-up Sichuan restaurant, the chef Ging Den Wang explores traditional dishes and his own variations, most of them expertly made and highly spiced."
"Güllüoglu","This trim Turkish bakery and cafe, an outpost of a company in Istanbul, has all the makings of a proper meal."
"Craftbar","A spinoff of Craft, Craftbar is a spare, welcoming room serving simple, comforting food."
"Insa","Officially a Korean barbecue restaurant, Insa sets itself apart through the modern chef’s sensibility displayed in the kitchen."
"Beco","Solid Brazilian cooking that doesn't try to do too much, tasty food to accompany a beer."
"Com Tam Ninh Kieu","The specialty at Com Tam Ninh Kieu in the Bronx, a Vietnamese restaurant,  is broken rice, grains splintered in the milling process, clingier and earthier than their grander, polished cousins. The rest of the menu consists almost entirely of noodle soups."
"La Boite en Bois","Cute and tiny, with forgettable but acceptable food."
"I Sodi","To eat at I Sodi is to abide by the laws of eating that Rita Sodi, the chef and an owner, brought with her from the farm north of Florence where she was raised."
"Café Rue Dix","Café Rue Dix is a restaurant firmly of the neighborhood but cosmopolitan in outlook, mixing plates of French moules frites and Senegalese thiebou djeun, spinning Edith Piaf between griot rap and mbalax."
"Picholine","This Lincoln Center area restaurant is never going to feel youthful and hip, but the chef and owner, Terrance Brennan, seized the occasion of a cosmetic overhaul to reinvigorate the restaurant's soul."
"Blanca","Carlo Mirarchi, the chef and owner of Blanca and its sprawling mothership, Roberta’s, is a rigorous miniaturist, combining a few ingredients at a time into two or three-bite compositions that are utterly complete, even if they leave you wanting more; over the years he has steadily refined his marathon tastings, and nearly everything served is remarkable in one way or another."
"Bar Primi","One of several reasons to like Bar Primi, Andrew Carmellini’s new two-story restaurant on the corner of Second Street and the Bowery, is that there is almost nothing on the menu but appetizers and pasta."
"The Wright","A striking homage to its namesake, the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, who designed the Guggenheim."
"Pio Pio Salon","A whole Peruvian-style roasted chicken is the trademark dish at the sixth of seven Pio Pios, and the largest in Manhattan."
"Haldi","Haldi’s menu is a delightful compendium of cultural references to the city of Kolkata in West Bengal, India, drawing on the culinary traditions of Bengalis, the British Raj, Marwari migrants from Rajasthan, Kolkata’s Chinatown (the birthplace of Indian Chinese cuisine) and the city’s small but once influential community of Baghdadi Jews."
"Taste Restaurant & Wine Bar","Taste, the restaurant and wine bar carved out of Eli's on the Upper East Side, lacks consistency."
"Porsena","Just what a small Italian restaurant in the Village should be: warm, modern, cozy and hip."
"Le Colonial","Beautiful people and refined Vietnamese food for the not terribly adventurous."
"DeFonte's of Brooklyn","After 87 years, this Red Hook, Brooklyn, institution for super-sized subs has opened a branch in Manhattan."
"Caviar Russe","Caviar Russe, with its blue and white walls and fanciful murals, seems to belong more in a fairy tale than in Midtown Manhattan."
"Smith & Wollensky Steak House","One of the few steakhouses that never lets you down: the service is swell, the steaks are always decent (if rarely great), and the portions are huge."
"Saraghina","This restaurant in pizzeria's clothing is pretty and unexpected addition to the neighborhood."
"Wallse","Kurt Gutenbrunner, the chef and owner of Wallsé, continues to be a great cook unfazed by his avant-garde contemporaries."
"Amber","This casual place offers Japanese, Chinese and Thai specialties."
"Lakruwana","Of the half-dozen or so Sri Lankan restaurants on Staten Island, Lakruwana is far and away the most spectacularly designed."
"Delaware and Hudson","Delaware and Hudson looks the part of the contemporary Brooklyn restaurant that preaches all things local and seasonal."
"Gigino","Comfortable, casual arty Italian in a trendy TriBeCa setting."
"Babu Ji","Babu Ji’s menu is succinct rather than sprawling, with Indian food that is remarkably fresh and light."
"Juventino","After a year of takeout with prepped ready-to-cook ingredients, this spot began offering table service for breakfast, lunch, brunch and dinner."
"Agata & Valentina","The long-awaited expansion is nearly complete, allowing for more prepared foods, produce and cheeses."
"Caridad China","As at other Chino Latino restaurants in New York City, no cross-pollination of seasonings is allowed, only congenial cohabitation on the table. The Chinese dishes are truer to the Chinese restaurants of 1980s America than to China, which means everything has a slightly caramel edge."
"Fowler & Wells","Tom Colicchio, the chef and owner, tries to bring some Gilded Age exuberance to this restaurant in a restored 1883 building. Many of the components, including the cocktails, wine list and desserts, are excellent. But in the menu and the décor, the central vision is fuzzy, and the restaurant is somehow less than the sum of its parts."
"Cafe D'Alsace","With more than 125 pilsners and lagers and bocks, along with a designated beer sommelier to explain them all, Cafe d'Alsace is New York's newest paradise for beer lovers."
"Izakaya","An izakaya is an informal Japanese establishment, neither quite restaurant nor tavern, that treats eating as fortification for drinking. But Dai Watanabe, the chef here, is not content to be an accompanist. The mission may be comfort food, but there’s a reverence to its making, even in the minor dishes."
"The Gander","Jesse Schenker, the Gander’s chef, had a breakout hit in 2010 with his debut restaurant, Recette. The Gander is more relaxed in ambition, aiming to be a neighborhood joint."
"Barbès","The food at Barbès is maddeningly uneven, but some of it has the straightforward, satisfying appeal of bistro fare."
"Sushi Katsuei","In Brooklyn, sushi bars have tended to hover at the level of the neighborhood joint — that is, until Sushi Katsuei opened on a corner of Park Slope."
"Thirty Acres","Thirty Acres is the kind of place that can redraw regional boundaries, making the Hudson River no more of a barrier to eaters in search of inventive cooking than the East River has become in the past few years."
"Kanoyama","Kanoyama has justly become a go-to place for sushi savants who are willing to trade away some atmosphere for top-flight fish at less-than-stratospheric prices."
"I Love Paraguay","I Love Paraguay started out as a bakery and Nancy Ojeda’s desserts, assembled in a case at the back, are still the main attraction, particularly mousse maracuja; the best entrees are the most traditional, like mbeju, a meld of cassava starch, milk, eggs and Muenster that suggests a further step in the evolution of a quesadilla, and chipa guazu, a savory cake sweetened with whole corn kernels and teetering on soufflé."
"En Japanese Brasserie","En Japanese Brasserie may showcase artisanal tofu, but what is so paradoxically striking about the restaurant is how familiar and redundant it feels."
"Ardesia","An unpretentious wine bar with about 30 wines by the glass and a menu of substantial bites, each saltier and tastier than the next."
"Mr. Chow Tribeca","Mr. Chow TriBeCa opened more than a quarter century after the Mr. Chow on East 57th Street but stays true to its predecessor's formula: a mixture of familiar and less familiar Chinese food in a slick setting with formally attired servers and an aura of clubby exclusivity."
"MarkJoseph Steakhouse","The MarkJoseph Steakhouse is betting on the burly appeal of Peter Luger, the 19th-century steakhouse, rather than offering a more refined 21st-century vision."
"Llama Inn","Llama Inn’s careful kitchen is interpreting the cuisine of Peru, whose vast catalog of ingredients and wild juxtapositions of influences have not been especially well displayed in New York."
"Beer Table",""
"Porter House New York","Inheriting the space in the Time Warner Center that belonged to V Steakhouse, Porter House New York takes a less cheeky, more earnest approach to rib-eyes and strips."
"Tabata Noodle","A bustling ramen shop just south of the Port Authority with excellent broths and friendly service."
"Dos Toros Taqueria","Dos Toros Taqueria brings to mind the sort of fresh, quick and cheap eating found at Mexican joints in the Bay Area."
"Flex Mussels","Flex Mussels shows off its mussels in more than 20 different dishes built around the bivalve."
"Arlington Club","A self-described steakhouse that can be experienced in any number of ways."
"Breeze","At Breeze, an electric Thai-French fusion place in Clinton, the food has plenty to compete with, but what's on the plate wins."
"Dovetail","Chef John Fraser and his pastry chef, Vera Tong, cook with intellect and wit, but they seldom get too cerebral, too cute."
"The Castello Plan","Quirky and wonderful wines are paired with delicious small plates, cured meats and cheeses at this Ditmas Park wine bar."
"Kao Soy","Kao Soy sells some of the dishes you know from your local Thai spot, but its mission is to turn New Yorkers on to what Sirichai Sreparplarn, one of the two chefs, calls “the real food from the North.” The northern Thai dishes are scattered around the menu. Most obvious is the excellent kao soy, made in the style of Ms. Supachana’s father back in Chiang Mai."
"5 Napkin Burger","The folks at Nice Matin knew they had a good thing in their burger. So they devoted a restaurant to it, where pre-show crowds sip cocktails beneath dangling meat hooks and Edison bulbs."
"Virage","This corner restaurant, with its unusual mosaics, squeezes a wide selection of dishes into a Mediterranean mold adding couscous as a side dish to otherwise culturally nondescript centerpieces."
"Glasserie","Glasserie’s chef, Sara Kramer, who spent time in the Marlow & Sons empire, diverges from the New Brooklyn model by reaching back to the Levantine spices of her Israeli heritage to create dishes that are at once artful and effortless."
"Chinese Mirch","At Chinese Mirch the dishes that blend Indian spices into Chinese dishes are the most successful."
"Artisanal","Artisanal remains an alluring destination for all kinds of gustatory debauchery."
"St. Dymphna's","St. Dymphna's is the sort of place where people go to drink sitting down, an oddity in the East Village."
"Tsampa","Tsampa, owned by four sisters, stands out from other Tibetan restaurants because the food is unusually well spiced."
"Michael's","Michael's, once an exemplar of California cuisine, has devolved into an uneven restaurant."
"Joe & Misses Doe","Eclectic influences, from Asian to Jewish, are combined at this small New American restaurant."
"Soba-Ya","Soba-ya's soba noodles — buckwheat, pale tan and smooth — are the focus at this bright little East Village restaurant."
"Carlyle Restaurant","After some productive time spent at the drawing board, the restaurant at the Carlyle Hotel has reopened with a new name and a much more pleasing personality. (Formerly known as Dumonet.)"
"The Handpulled Noodle","The hand-pulled noodles at this counter-seating-only restaurant come from Xinjiang, in China’s far northwest, and they are denser and rougher than the more widely known Lanzhou-style hand-pulled noodles found in Chinatown, and fantastically chewy; Andrew Ding, the owner, was born in Urumqi and raised in Sydney, Australia -- both parts of the world share a love of lamb, and that meat is what gives contour and depth to the finest dishes here."
"Daisy May's BBQ USA","At Daisy May's, if you prefer not to see your food's face, you may want to choose the shoulder or the rack of lamb."
"2nd City","At this Filipino-leaning taqueria, the chef Jordan Andino turns lumpia wrappers into chips, for dunking in suka; anoints tacos with sinigang, a tangy tamarind soup; and otherwise makes what he calls “AmAsian,” or American-Asian, food — more general than specific."
"District Saigon","At this restaurant run by a Vietnamese-born father and his American-raised son, the depth of the pho is something of a surprise, given other offerings that seem slightly canted to please American palates."
"Jacques Torres Chocolate","Jacques Torres's chocolates and pastries require a trek to the Brooklyn waterfront, but it's worth the trip."
"Desnuda","A romantically lighted sliver of a bar in the East Village serving Nuevo Latino-accented food."
"Sripraphai","Sripraphai, a delicious destination in Woodside, Queens, is the real deal, well worth the extra time and effort."
"Victor's Cafe","This old theater district standby offers Cuban food in an upscale atmosphere."
"Claw","The interior of this lobster-roll joint is cream and queasy coral pink, the ghost of bridesmaid dresses past. But the lobster is vivid, shipped live from Maine and steamed on site."
"Bar Corvo","Bar Corvo is sleeker than its shabby-chic older sister, Al di Là’, but less daring in the kitchen. It is not quite a destination restaurant, just the restaurant everybody wants in their neighborhood."
"Purple Yam","At Purple Yam, the menu has old Filipino favorites but also looks widely across Asia for inspiration, most notably toward Korea, the cuisine of which provides both kimchi and flavored sojus, a mean bibimbap and a spicy tofu soup."
"Almond","A 170-seat branch of the popular French bistro in Bridgehampton, N.Y."
"Salinas","Salinas explores traditional Spanish cuisine, serving confident, if not ground-breaking, food."
"La Superior","La Superior resists the urge to milk extra cash out of carnitas-starved Brooklyn residents."
"Rustic L.E.S.","Rustic L.E.S. is the name of this tiny restaurant in the far east of the Lower East Side, and it looks it, with faint stains of light from bare bulbs against exposed brick and concrete."
"Sushi on Jones","This tiny, no-frills open-air sushi bar is one of five kiosks in the Bowery Market food court, on a lot once home to an auto-repair shop. Guests are given 30 minutes to dine; the clock starts at reservation time. This might seem ruthless, but the price is kind: $50 for 12 pieces of beautifully fresh fish. The menu reads like a classic-rock playlist — hamachi, salmon, tuna — but there are surprises, like scallop with smoky black salt and uni draped over seared wagyushu beef."
"Cut by Wolfgang Puck","Wolfgang Puck’s hotel steakhouse, his first venture in Manhattan, felt dated as soon as it opened. The steaks are excellent; other dishes are appealing, if a little unfocused, and the interior design appears to have been lost in the mail for a decade or so."
"Parmys Persian Fusion","The mostly classical Persian dishes come from Mom’s recipes, according to the brother-and-sister owners: dense, rich stews, respectably charred kebabs and  tahdig."
"Bunna Cafe","In February, 2014, what was a vegan lunch counter, open four days a week, is now a full-time
restaurant, open seven days a week.  It now has tables."
"Schiller's Liquor Bar","At Schiller's Liquor Bar, Keith McNally and his team of chefs from Balthazar and Pastis have created an international hipster commissary."
"Taqueria Y Fonda La Mexicana","Taquerìa is particularly interesting because of its extensive and unusual menu."
"Bobwhite Lunch & Supper Counter","Southern fried chicken is the mission at Bobwhite Lunch & Supper Counter, a small, no-fuss storefront in Alphabet City, whose owner and chef, Keedick Coulter, hails from Roanoke, Va."
"Terroir","Terroir is a mini-restaurant in wine-bar drag, proof that wine bars have evolved too fast for nomenclature to keep up."
"Alma","A restaurant at the edge of Carroll Gardens with thoughtful, precise cooking and a spectacular view."
"Locol","The chefs Daniel Patterson and Roy Choi are trying to do so many things with their insurgent fast-food chain, Locol, that it almost has to fall short somewhere. What is surprising, though, is that they would have so much trouble with the food."
"Sabry's","No one is going to Sabry's, an Egyptian spot in Astoria, for its looks. They are going for fish."
"Le Cirque","After nearly four decades, Sirio Maccioni still greets each table at Le Cirque, flattering loyal customers and pretending to recognize new ones."
"Uma's","Uma’s may be the only Uzbek restaurant in the United States (or the world) with surfboard parking, the Velvet Underground blaring and organic kale salad as an occasional special."
"Takashi","A wondrous strange restaurant in the West Village that specializes in raw offal and Korean-style Japanese barbecue."
"Café Sabarsky","Many of the visitors to the Neue Galerie museum may be whizzing through the exhibits to get to the coffee and pastry at Cafe Sabarsky."
"Buka","Traditional Nigerian fare in an airy, shabby-chic setting, catering to expats and intrepid eaters."
"Kingswood","Any questions about Kingswood’s Australian identity should be dispelled by the menu's big flavor combinations – and by the restaurant's patrons."
"Novitá","A designer shoe box of a restaurant around the corner from Gramercy Park, Novitá is perfect neighborhood trattoria."
"Alibaba","A new idea for Thanksgiving?: The turkey shawarma at this spot is juicy and succulent."
"Dhaba","The food at Dhaba is lively, with surprisingly complex and subtle flavors, and a menu with more than 125 items, not including the lunch specials."
"The Fat Radish","A spare, loftlike restaurant on lower Orchard Street with a beautiful crowd and a menu that is British after a fashion, rustic at that, lighter than its promise, often more flavorful."
"Co.","One of the most frequently mobbed and fervently discussed of the city's new artisanal pizza places, Co. actually strives and manages to be a relatively complete restaurant."
"Umami Burger","Adam Fleischman devised the Umami burger recipe in his home kitchen in Los Angeles in a single day. The result is a good, occasionally exceptional burger, which for all the umami bluster isn’t notably different from other good burgers around town."
"Fishtail by David Burke","At Fishtail by David Burke, the chef, who's known for his showmanship, concentrates on seafood."
"Catch","Can you eat well at a restaurant with 260 seats, bored hostesses, incoherent decor and a party-platter-friendly menu primed for franchising? Confoundingly, yes. Much of the menu reads like a catalogue: you may order crab by the pound, seafood by the tower, oysters and Krug as a gift set, and mix-and-match fishes and sauces."
"Indochine","Indochine has become a museum, more or less, that draws young people who consider it an anachronistic hoot."
"Fedora","Hip but friendly Fedora serves up an antique aesthetic, fatty-chic food and a modern Bohemian crowd."
"The Clocktower","The Clocktower plays a familiar game, the private club that has accidentally let you in, but the cooking of Jason Atherton, an English chef who worked under Gordon Ramsay, has the peculiar idea of cooking to make other people happy, not to reflect his own glory."
"Chin Chin","A rep-tie Chinese restaurant in Midtown on the East Side, with food that is neither particularly Cantonese nor Sichuan, nor from any other identifiable Chinese region."
"Clyde Frazier's Wine and Dine","It is Godzilla in chinchilla, this debonair beast of a restaurant that presides over the far West Side, sprawling the length of a city block."
"Mehtaphor","Jehangir Mehta made his name as a brilliant and contrarian pastry chef; at his own restaurant, he seems to have mellowed."
"Strong Place","A neighborhood place with a finely wrought New American menu that scales from downhome-ish to uptown-ish."
"Bobo","There is a sense of caution at Bobo, a feeling that the menu is driven too much by what diners expect and too little by real inspiration."
"Abyssinia","Frehiwot Reta, the chef and owner of Abyssinia, has long been known among New York’s Ethiopians as a master of injera, the round, sour flatbread, more than a foot in diameter and riddled with sinkholes, that is the base of every Ethiopian meal. She sold injera out of her Harlem apartment for a decade before opening this modest restaurant."
"SobaKoh","Though SobaKoh doesn't go out of its way to trumpet the seasonality of its menu, the dishes change regularly and usually are in step with what is in season."
"Chola","Very good, seriously intended Indian food served in uninspiring surroundings."
"Hunan Manor","The menu at Hunan Manor includes a few Sichuan classics, but mostly you will find unmitigated heat of Hunan dishes, without the tempering sweetness or the pins and needles along the tongue that come with Sichuan cuisine."
"Farm on Adderley","For a place run by first-time restaurateurs, the Farm on Adderley is getting a lot of things right in the dining room."
"Sant Ambroeus","Everything looks good at Sant Ambroeus, but much of the food lacks taste."
"The Plaza Food Hall","In the basement of the Plaza Hotel, a cheerful hybrid of an American food court and a European brasserie."
"El Molcajete","From downtown Manhattan, El Molcajete is not much farther than the late-night taco trucks on Roosevelt Avenue in Queens or the taquerias of Bushwick and Sunset Park, Brooklyn, and as serious a destination"
"Brooklyn Crab","A block from the Red Hook waterfront stands Brooklyn Crab, a shanty writ large, three stories high and already looking faintly dilapidated, although it was built this past year."
"Neta","One of the two chefs who founded Neta, Nick Kim, was head chef at Masa. His partner, Jimmy Lau, was head chef at Bar Masa, where among other duties he was in charge of international fish buying. But sushi purists looking for hard-to-obtain Japanese seafood species are likely to be disappointed. Instead, Neta has compensatory pleasures, like the quality of its rice, the exceptional vegetable sushi and above all the small plates."
"15 East","15 East stands out in a crowded marketplace of Japanese restaurants that focus on uncooked seafood."
"Paet Rio","Phimploy Likitsansook has brought over a few of her secrets from her Hell’s Kitchen restaurant Wondee Siam, but the execution is more focused, the contours of flavor more distinct, and a few dishes approach greatness."
"Bella Luna","The food can be uneven, but there are enough satisfying options to please a neigborhood crowd."
"Eolo Sicilia a Tavola","An ambitious attempt in Chelsea to present Sicilian food beyond square pizza."
"Taboon","At Taboon, a Middle-Eastern inflected restaurant in the Clinton section of midtown Manhattan, it's all about the oven: a brick-walled, cement-coated, wood-burning hive that's situated near the entrance and grabs your attention the minute you walk in the door."
"Spigolo","In a charming, intimate and noisy room on the Upper East Side, Spigolo serves honest, earnest Italian and Mediterranean fare."
"Caracas Arepa Bar","Caracas Arepa Bar boasts one of the most consistent kitchens of any cheap food spot in New York."
"Chaiwali","On two lovingly decorated floors of a Harlem brownstone, this restaurant serves the relaxed, light-handed, modern food that Americans with roots in India may cook at home."
"Masha & the Bear","At Masha and the Bear, the horseradish vodka is infused in-house and stored in pressurized kegs to avoid exposure to air; Anya Vasilenko, the chef, cleaves to tradition with dishes like ukha, a fish soup purportedly beloved by Ivan the Terrible, and Herring in a Fur Coat, a salad born of the Russian Revolution, uniting proletarian herring and peasant potatoes under a mantle of beets in Bolshevik red."
"Buddakan New York","Buddakan is the apotheosis of a distinct genre: the post-millennial urban mess hall as supersize cocktail lounge with stylized dishes, which chart a far-out trip to the Far East."
"Cafecito Bogota","At this Colombian cafe and wine bar, arepas are broad, flat, piled high with toppings and best approached with knife and fork."
"Candle 79","Candle 79 doesn't quite make you forget that meat, fish, dairy and eggs aren't coming to the party."
"Luke’s Lobster","The purest Down East flavor the city has to offer."
"Joy Luck Palace","Much of the food — classics like stuffed bitter melon alongside faddishly cute pig-shaped custard buns — is good, if not transcendent, at this dim sum hall in Manhattan’s Chinatown. Expect a long wait and mayhem."
"Miss Lily’s Favourite Cakes","Sightly haute-ified Jamaican food in a diner environment."
"Barclays Center","Barclays Center’s spaceship-shiny silver lobby is lined with with 12 permanent concessions that all make some claim to a Brooklyn bond."
"Minca","The chef at Minca calls it a ramen factory, but there is little about the place that suggests an assembly line."
"Botequim","Botequim has Brazilian food that, under the direction of the chef Marco Moreira, is really too good to be trapped in the basement of a hotel on Fourth Avenue."
"Capital Grille","The servers at Capital Grille seem to have graduated from master classes in solicitous smiling, but the food they carry out is less assured."
"Please Don't Tell","The deep-fried hot dogs at PDT offer a different take altogether on cocktail food, though the flavor basics are the same."
"Brooklyn Ball Factory","A Japanese comfort food and coffee shop in East Williamsburg with a rooftop deck. As for the brief menu, the ingredients are not extraordinary, the preparations not complicated. They don’t need to be."
"Tut’s Hub Royal Cuisine","A few blocks south of the Little Egypt strip in Astoria, Queens, Tut’s Hub stands three stories, crowned by the sun disk of Aten and guarded by a statue of the warrior goddess Sekhmet. The surroundings are lofty, but few dishes rise above $10, orders are placed at the cash register and the best dishes have roots in the streets."
"Mojito","At Mojito — which is well balanced, like a good cocktail — Cuban kitsch doesn't overwhelm the Brooklynness of the place."
"Onomea","Spam gets pride of place at Onomea, which serves Hawaiian food in a dining room that suggests a sauna in the middle of a rain forest."
"Mission Chinese Food","Idiosyncrasy is to Mission Chinese Food what the Bloomin’ Onion is to an Outback Steakhouse, and at its new location, the restaurant's menu is more varied than before, drawing from regions beyond Sichuan and countries beyond China."
"Dickson’s Farmstand Meats","This butcher shop’s weekday-only lunch menu offers a thoughtful primer on Dickson’s splendid, locally sourced meats."
"Tito King’s Kitchen at Jimmy’s No. 43","At Tito King’s, a restaurant-in-residence at Jimmy’s No. 43, the brief menu includes chicken wings braised in adobo; pork belly in tacos; a grass-fed burger with a trickle of Maggi sauce; and a take on disco fries with ground pork, Kewpie mayonnaise and dancing bonito flakes doing the Hustle."
"Tao","Tao is not so much a restaurant as a nonstop party interrupted by funny food."
"Blue Fin","Blue Fin, in the W Times Square Hotel, serves fish of unmistakable quality."
"Frankies 457 Court Street Spuntino","The two Frankies have adapted Italian-American recipes with better-than-usual ingredients, a dash of nostalgia and some creative interpretation."
"Armani Ristorante Fifth Avenue","Armani Ristorante, on the third floor of the Armani store on Fifth Avenue, looks a little odd, but when the menu is at its best, it takes its cues from the understated style of Milanese cuisine."
"Estiatorio Milos","Since 1997, Milos has served Greek cuisine, particularly whole fish and shellfish kept on ice near the open kitchen, to loyal customers who can afford the forbidding prices."
"Kai Feng Fu Dumpling House","One of the best places in New York to try niu rou shao bing, an exquisite sandwich on bread that rivals anything from Sullivan Street Bakery."
"Arabelle","Arabelle has all the charm in the world -- but for a truly great meal at the Plaza Athénée, you'll have to fly to Paris.
Video Tour"
"One if by Land, Two if by Sea","One if by Land, which has been around since 1972, needs to do better, though it can probably get by on ambience alone."
"Corkbuzz Wine Studio","A spacious, sleek, friendly wine bar with a global spin."
"B & K French Cuisine","Benjamin Baccari Kebe, the owner and chef of this tiny Harlem storefront, brings classical French technique to a simple, gently priced menu, braising beef for hours just for a sandwich and making fish and chips with a batter so buoyant, it looks like armored air."
"Tamarind Tribeca","It may seem like it might be a pan-Indian food mill for the professional class, but Tamarind is an extremely pleasant place to dine."
"Mas","Even as it ages Mas still feels every bit as attentive, eager and earnest as it did when it opened in March 2004."
"Tanoshi","Tanoshi is a surprise in a city with few options for sushi between the wincingly expensive and the suspiciously cheap."
"Ngam","Hong Thaimee, a native of Thailand who has cooked for the royal family there, reinterprets Thai cuisine as modern comfort food."
"Whitehall Bar and Kitchen","British-themed and, surprisingly, kind of sexy."
"Ici","Ici is a sweet restaurant in Fort Greene full of unpretentious pleasures."
"Riverpark","A shimmery addition to the empire of Tom Colicchio, Riverpark is at the end of a private street on the far eastern shore of Kips Bay."
"Frankie & Johnnie's","A perennially packed steakhouse on 45th Street where the drinks are strong. Meyer Lansky no longer sits at the bar, though you can occasionally find Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick."
"Kaffe 1668","Lattes in paper cups for New Yorkers on the run; for the obsessed, seasonal single-origin espresso."
"Sable's","The selection of smoked fish is terrific at Sable's, a narrow store with barely enough room for people to line up at the counter."
"A-Wah","This bright, homey restaurant serves more than a dozen varieties of the Hong Kong specialty called bo zai fan, or ""clay pot rice"" in Cantonese."
"Gabriel Kreuther","Gabriel Kreuther named his new restaurant on 42nd Street after himself, but it could just as easily be called the Modern in Exile, as he took along that restaurant's pastry chef and replicated its two-in-one structure."
"Patina","It can be an intimate, if slightly disorienting experience dining at this very small West African restaurant in the Bronx. No menu is presented, at least not in written form, and only a few dishes are available at a time. But the food is delicious: earthy soups and stews over dense, chewy rice and black-eyed peas, with seams of heat from hidden Scotch bonnets."
"Maoz Vegetarian","With shops on three continents, Amsterdam-born Maoz Vegetarian is a falafel chain that's achieved the success other such ventures might envy."
"Koi","Koi is big, bold and delightfully kooky, but the cuisine is much less certain than the sexy vibe."
"L'Artusi","L'Artusi, the new venture by the team behind dell'Anima, is fitfully enjoyable."
"Da Andrea","At Da Andrea, what had been a dependably average West Village Italian restaurant soon revealed itself to be something else: a dependably good local favorite, one with ambition."
"Telepan Local","Telepan Local offers almost none of the virtues of small-plates eating with most of the drawbacks."
"Uncle Boons","This dark, woody, half-underground Thai pub serves some of the freshest and most dynamic Thai flavors in the city."
"Fu Run","A bright, friendly restaurant near the 7 train, specializing in Beijing- and Northeast-style Chinese food."
"Cagen","Toshio Tomita, the chef and owner, worked for 16 years for Nobu Matsuhisa, and he has his mentor’s ability to bend Japanese tradition in his own directions."
"Gran Eléctrica","Gran Eléctrica, an upscale Mexican restaurant near the Dumbo waterfront in Brooklyn, wants to have it both ways: to be elevated yet rustic, chic yet homey."
"Commerce","Commerce strikes a visual and auditory pose that combines elements of the Waverly Inn with strains of Balthazar, but its menu and dishes are fussier, in ways that sometimes undercut the food's appeal."
"Shuko","Jimmy Lau and Nick Kim, the chefs and owners, rose to the top of Masa Takayama’s restaurant group. What’s impressive about their own restaurant, Shuko, is how many times the chefs ring the bells without resorting to clichéd indulgences."
"Krystal's Cafe","The truth is Filipino cuisine is as homey and accessible as any kind of cooking; Krystal's Cafe in Woodside hammers that lesson home."
"Taam-Tov","Taam-Tov is the best deal in the diamond district."
"Parm","The second restaurant from Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone treats the sandwiches and steam-table contorni of Italian delis as a legitimate subspecies of American cuisine that deserves respect."
"The Cannibal","Resto’s Christian Pappanicholas expands with this butcher shop and beer bar with great snacks."
"The Islands","The quirks make the Islands, a Jamaican spot in Brooklyn, feel like a home kitchen, but it's the food that makes it worth a visit."
"Wassail","The all-vegetable menu and the staggering variety of ciders make it clear that Wassail’s owners are obsessed in the best possible way."
"Kaz an Nou","A tiny, romantic French-Guadeloupe eatery run by a charming young couple who make earthy, comforting food."
"Mile End Sandwich","Mile End Sandwich, the Manhattan offshoot of Mile End deli in Brooklyn, looks more like a Helmut Lang boutique than an appetizing shop. The roster of sandwiches, more expansive than in Brooklyn, reads like a family album of the Jewish diaspora."
"Il Giglio","While it is possible to get decent pasta at Il Giglio, the farther the menu strays from Italy, the better the food."
"Ruffian Wine Bar & Chef’s Table","The scope of the wine list and the inventiveness of the cooking are among the more impressive feats pulled off by this narrow sliver of a wine bar."
"Alouette","When this casual French restaurant opened in early 1998, it created a buzz of excitement in a neighborhood not used to exciting restaurants."
"Cipriani Downtown","Good Italian food at outrageous prices."
"Cafe Riazor","Sample Spanish classics — shrimp, chorizo, octopus, pork — at this subterranean restaurant in the middle of a residential block in Chelsea."
"Circus","Relocated, but still serving Brazilian fare to beautiful Brazilians."
"The Simone","A classic Manhattan restaurant that seems to have emerged fully formed out of a time capsule sealed in the last century, the Simone has the kind of warmth that has become rare in Manhattan’s increasingly corporatized restaurant scene."
"Limani","Limani’s menu is Greek and its strength is formidably expensive seafood, which up until the moment it is laid on the grill can be found spread out on a small mountain of ice at the edge of the open kitchen."
"Wasan","The rigorous techniques of washoku, classical Japanese cuisine, are upheld at Wasan, and infused with a sly affection for the chefs’ adopted city."
"Zaytoons","Few other moderately priced Middle Eastern restaurants offer the combination of genial, relaxed surroundings and simple but meticulously prepared food that Zaytoons does."
"Ippudo","A bowl of ramen at Ippudo isn't just a meal: it's an invitation to get lost in a world of layered, nuanced flavors."
"Red Rooster Harlem","Marcus Samuelsson’s vibrant restaurant on Lenox Avenue is that rarest of cultural institutions, one that supports not just the idea or promise of diversity, but diversity itself."
"Delicatessen","Delicatessen, specializing in interpretive comfort food, may not be particularly good, but it's smart, and it understands its audience."
"Anjappar","Chettinadu cuisine, the specialty of this New York franchise of a Chennai-based chain, is surprisingly meat-centric, considering its origins in vegetarian-dominated southern India."
"Ali Baba's Terrace","A sibling of the Turkish restaurant Ali Baba, this newer location has a lengthier menu that includes the same sparkling array of dips and spreads with puffy bread."
"Karasu","Karasu is a speakeasy behind the back wall of a corner tavern. The first surprising thing about the food is that there is any. The second is that it’s so polished and considered."
"Baoburg","Baoburg’s idiosyncratic menu owes as much to classical European technique as it does to the cross-cultural upbringing of the chef, Suchanan Aksornnan."
"Il Postino","Although it's not worth the money, the northern Italian food is good."
"Empanada Mama","One thing is certain at Empanada Mama, the first Manhattan outpost of the Queens-based Mama's Empanadas chainlet: these are not your mother's empanadas."
"East Coast Poké","Brooklyn-born Alfred DiMartini, a former line cook at Lupa and Bouley, makes fine, honest poke, without too many complications."
"Pig and Khao","Eating at this restaurant can be like poring over an album of carefully edited postcards from chef Leah Cohen's travels."
"Ristorante Morini","Most of the food here is as carefully prepared and well-considered food as any that Michael White’s Altamarea Group has given New York since Ai Fiori opened in 2010."
"The Red Cat","By turns cozy and sexy, laid-back and fleet, the Red Cat is immensely appealing."
"Recette","An ambitious restaurant in the space of a deeply casual one, with a menu that appears to embrace the small-plates trend."
"Crave Fishbar","Though seafood (including hake in an Asian broth and tilefish with pea purée) dominates the menu, meat-eaters will find grilled veal tongue, steak and fried chicken."
"Taim","Taim's falafel, transformed by the fresh herbs that go into the dough, is at the front of the pack."
"Alfama","With few options in Manhattan for Portuguese food, Alfama can sate cravings for salt cod, chourico and creamy desserts."
"Sakagura","If you do Sakagura right, there will be much sake to sop up."
"Cafe Steinhof","Cafe Steinhof in Park Slope is just about New York's homiest Austrian outpost."
"Kefi","In a new location on the Upper West Side that more than doubles its size, Kefi still offers robust, generously portioned Greek cooking at contained prices that make it feel like a bargain."
"Bar Americain","The fact that décor and food seem color-coordinated at Bar Americain is a testament to the unsubtle, upbeat spirit of Bobby Flay's cooking."
"Ditch Plains","A sleek lobster shack in the West Village from restaurateurs Marc and Pamela Schein Murphy, the duo behind Landmarc."
"Maya","Some of New York City's most interesting Mexican food is served in a bright, festive room."
"Ayada","A serious Thai restaurant in Elmhurst, Queens, that makes no concessions to Western palates."
"Hanjan","Hooni Kim has quickly become New York’s leading interpreter of Korean cuisine."
"'21' Club","There are only a few things at “21” that one can order with any anticipation: the famous chicken hash, the “21” burger and the coconut cake, topped with a beehive of white meringue and toasted coconut. But to judge “21” as a restaurant is to miss the point of the place."
"Hope & Anchor","This neighborhood place in a neighborhood that doesn't have a lot of people offers both upscale and down-home dishes."
"Tipsy Parson","Tipsy Parson is a grandmotherly Chelsea restaurant serving small-town restaurant fare."
"Kichin","At Kichin, a mostly Korean, mostly takeout shop under the Marcy Avenue L train stop, the young chef Bryan Moon champions the dishes of his childhood and invents a few of his own, including a rice ball prickly with bacon shards, hiding a soft-boiled quail egg at its center."
"Plant Love House","At this cheerful, unassuming storefront, Manadsanan Sutipayakul is cooking for the neighborhood: the clientele is mostly Thai, the dishes comforting rather than showy. Her daughters make the desserts, which include sizzling platters designed to make you gasp or giggle."
"La Paella","Dark, crowded, smoky and loud, La Paella is like an American's fantasy of a Spanish tapas bar and includes the basic tapas repertory."
"Good Fork","The Good Fork has an accessible menu that neighborhood folks can rely on for a simple dinner but that boasts enough rewarding dishes to lure bridge and tunnel folks out to Red Hook."
"Il Mulino","Big portions, long waits, a halcyon atmosphere."
"Grano Trattoria","Dishes are remarkably inconsistent, from appealing appetizers and pastas to main courses that can be wretched."
"Bouley","David Bouley’s new flagship for his refined French fare is the grandest yet, but maintains a vaulted ceiling, here glossed in gold. Workmen and materials, including hand-cut stone and 300-year-old wooden beams, have been brought from France to create a downtown chateau, with a hand-painted garden room, a library and a romantic lower-level 'cave.' The cooks have not been forgotten either, with a windowed, street-level kitchen paneled in marble. The former Bouley, on the corner of Duane Street and West Broadway, will become a market, and Upstairs at Bouley Bakery will spill down into what is now the market and bakery, doubling its seating."
"Egg","The fried chicken at Egg in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is so good I watched a Southern-born friend devour nearly two whole portions in one sitting."
"Pasquale Jones","The menu flits from pizza to pasta to the inevitable small plates to a rib-eye for two; most of the food is cooked in wood-burning ovens; and the noteworthy wine list roams beyond Italy and offers bottles that used to be considered too good for a pizza parlor."
"Forcella","Some of the pizzas at Forcella, a pizzeria serving Naples-style pies, are championship-caliber."
"El Centro","El Centro has some significant shortcomings on its menu, but it's worth a visit just for the Mexican dishes and the drinks that it gets right."
"Arpeggio Food and Wine","Restaurant Associates has reconfigured Avery Fisher Hall's dining options with a wine bar, Arpeggio Food and Wine, open until midnight."
"Hill Country Chicken","Hill Country Chicken turns out some top-level Southern food."
"Machiavelli","A grand, artsy homage to Italian food, with Renaissance-style murals, live piano music and a dedicated pasta chef."
"David Burke Townhouse","Diners here are in for terrific savories, a reasonable and unusual wine list and excellent people-watching."
"Sfoglia","Less a showy bid for greatness than an earnest reach for goodness, Sfoglia hits its mark and then some, with inventive pasta dishes, carefully cooked meat and seafood, a few knockout desserts and some of the best bread in all of Manhattan."
"Lumpia Shack Snackbar","At Lumpia Shack Snackbar, Neil Syham, the chef, makes pretty but still potent versions of Filipino classics. There are just a few stools along the counter, which is too bad, because this is food best eaten on the spot."
"Kurumazushi","Hidden on the second floor of an intensely Ben Katchoresque office building filled with gem dealers, Kurumazushi is one of New York’s oldest sushi restaurants."
"Tomoe Sushi","Small, plain Tomoe has terrific sushi — which explains the perpetual long lines."
"Sadelle’s","A superb bakery is at the core of a sprawling restaurant that serves smoked fish and other Jewish coffee shop food by day and refined Eastern European plates by night."
"Kristalbelli","Korean barbecue goes upscale, with smokeless grills made of crystal, sommeliers and prices to match."
"Kodama Japanese Restaurant","Although the decor is drab and the menu almost frighteningly large, this remains a perennially popular restaurant with people who work at The New York Times."
"Le Coucou","At Daniel Rose’s first restaurant in New York, the cooking is informed by old-school traditions, focuses on animal parts, and revolves around glossy, spoon-coating, cream- and butter-reinforced sauces."
"Roman's","The structure of Roman's maddening menu is offset by its clean, almost monastically pure cooking."
"Nomad","A Nomad in the East Village, you’ll find aggressively and expertly spiced Algerian sausages and cravable, eye-opening pastries."
"Amma","By taking the back roads, and steering clear of the tired tourist sites, Amma shows diners a different India, so old that it seems fresh."
"Pata Cafe","At this offshoot of the Thai bar Pata Paplean, a tree climbs from the floor through the ceiling. It’s as if you’d popped through a trap door into a secret clubhouse. Sunisa Nitmai, a native of Isan, Thailand’s northeast, cooks as she would at home: plain-spoken Thai dishes, none over $10, that taste of gestures timeworn but never taken for granted, and of honest pleasure in what a handful of ingredients can do."
"'Wichcraft","The sandwiches are good at this Tom Colicchio-backed fancy sandwich chainlet."
"Lucky Eight","At 5204 Eighth Avenue, Sunset Park, Brooklyn, Lucky Eight is a small place with a big repertory spread across three menus."
"Locanda Verde","The chef Andrew Carmellini's cooking at Locanda Verde lacks the polish of his efforts at A Voce, but the best of it makes for a terrific meal."
"Cafe Katja","A tiny, spirited Austrian spot on the Lower East Side."
"Bien Cuit","Artisanal breads and pastries worthy of Paris."
"Rusty Knot","The Rusty Knot takes its lack of pretension seriously, which is no doubt oxymoronic and the very essence of its charm."
"Tiella","A “tiella&quot; is a roasting pan in Italy; in this tiny brick-walled spot, it’s a pan pizza, dressed with luxurious toppings of prosciutto, bottarga and truffle."
"Coppelia","This self-styled 24-hour Cuban luncheonette serves a wide-ranging menu of Latino food from across the Caribbean and into South America."
"5 Ninth","Like the meatpacking district, in which it resides, 5 Ninth is for people who are willing to choose unsteady exuberance over steady expertise."
"Kabab King Diner","Perhaps it's fitting that a place celebrating the humble kebab is itself as humble and unprepossessing as Kabab King Diner in Jackson Heights, Queens."
"Claudette","Claudette serves Provençal cuisine with an intelligent twist. Rather than treating the region as if it were frozen in time and sealed off from the world, the kitchen casts a few glances at the North African immigrants who live and cook there."
"La Tortilleria Los Hermanos","The menu at La Tortillería Mexicana Los Hermanos is sparse, but when top-notch tacos are available, how much else does one need?"
"Pam Real Thai Food","At this sweet little restaurant in Clinton, the compromises are not always obvious."
"Korchma Taras Bulba","Sometimes a lot of strong liquor and a little rich food are just the thing, and the Ukrainian fare at Taras Bulba has the combination nailed."
"Leche y Miel Restaurant","Rideiby Peña, the chef of Leche y Miel, and his wife, Altagracia Peña, both have roots in the Dominican Republic, as do the finest dishes here."
"Rickshaw Dumpling Bar","Some items have inched closer to deliciousness since it opened, but much of the food still lacks oomph."
"Shalom Japan","Shalom Japan’s unlikely name makes a merry hash of the cultural heritages of the married owners and chefs, Aaron Israel and Sawako Okochi."
"Azalea","Fate has dealt Azalea a couple of tough cards, but the kitchen does its best to overcome them."
"Dogmatic","These wieners are so high-minded, they're served in baguettes."
"Yopparai","Everything at Yopparai is designed to unknot the mind: cushioned benches for two in lieu of bar stools; sake poured in doll-size cups, forcing you to sip; comforting small plates and rustic snacks; a cloudy undertow of jazz. At this modest sake bar, you eat the way you drink, in tiny mouthfuls. And so the hours drift. You will not notice."
"Saravana Bhavan","A vegetarian Southern India-style restaurant in Murray Hill."
"Angela’s","At her namesake restaurant, due north of some of the city’s more celebrated Trinidadian roti and doubles shops, Angela Pellew-Whyte presents pan-Caribbean dishes — saltfish and bake, curry goat, a profound oxtail stew — under a wooden chandelier, as what sounds like one eternal song loops from the speakers."
"Kottu House","At Kottu House, Chelaka Gunamuni, a young man in stubbly beard and tattoos (one a birthday gift from his wife), tends to the front of the house while his mother, Sandya “Madu” De Silva, cooks a short menu focused on kottu, a Sri Lankan street food that tosses together tatters of roti, scrambled eggs and long-simmering curry."
"Temple Canteen","It is amazing what the cooks at Temple Canteen can conjure up with little more than lentil-rice flour, loads of butter and a giant, searing hot griddle. Tubular paper dosas are vellum thin and shatteringly crisp. As long as a grown man’s arm, they are bigger even than the cafeteria-style plastic trays that are provided for ferrying the food from counter to table."
"Casa la Femme","There's really no escaping Casa la Femme North's facile exoticism, but the food is impressive."
"Nom Wah Tea Parlor","The first dim sum joint in Chinatown has dispensed with metal carts and serves dim sum made to order."
"Urubamba","The earth-toned interior provides a subdued setting for the often colorful Peruvian fare."
"Esca","Is Dave Pasternack a fish whisperer? On the evidence of Esca, the answer seems to be yes."
"Scalini Fedeli","Scalini Fedeli has no edge. What it has, instead, is old-fashioned grace."
"Somtum Der","Called som tum in Thailand, papaya salad gives this nearly three-month-old restaurant its name and is its star attraction, made to order in eight variations."
"Papaye","Located on a sunny corner of the Grand Concourse, Papaye serves Ghanaian cooking that can be deeply satisfying."
"Gobo","Gobo deals in a fair amount of faux food, some of which flops and some of which succeeds."
"Carteles","This adorable, brightly tiled East Village cafe serves a knock-out sandwich they call a Cubano Christo and other Cuban dishes."
"Cafe China","This quaint, demure restaurant serves uncompromising Sichuan food that can stand with Manhattan’s best."
"Tocqueville","Tocqueville's shortcomings are more noticeable in the context of a new space — and new expectations — but the considerable pleasures of Marco Moreira's cooking are intact."
"Dinosaur Bar-B-Que","It will take something short of a miracle to turn Dinosaur Bar-B-Que into the barbecue refuge New Yorkers have been hoping for."
"Shanghai Pavilion","The food at Shanghai Pavilion is lively and balanced, emphasizing the lightness and delicacy for which Shanghai cooking is known."
"Salt & Fat","Daniel Yi, the chef and owner of Salt & Fat, describes his cooking as New American, and in a sense it is exactly, exultingly that — the food of the new America, in which immigrants companionably raid one another’s larders."
"Calexico Carne Asada","This Carroll Gardens taqueria serves a carne asada quesadilla that has a punch of flavor so intense, it’s hard to justify ordering anything else."
"Locanda Vini e Olii","Passion rules at Locanda Vini & Olii, and it is evident in almost every bite."
"Caravan of Dreams","The food at this vegan restaurant, which looks more like a college hangout than a health-food spot, is nothing to sneer at."
"The  Russian Tea Room","After a four-year hibernation, the Russian Tea Room stirred to renewed life in early November with a seriously gifted chef, Gary Robins, in charge of the kitchen."
"Shake Shack","The salty, meaty little burgers swaddled by potato rolls are so good that Shake Shack is swarmed with diners."
"Little Park","At Little Park, Andrew Carmellini and his chef de cuisine, Min Kong, are working out their ideas from scratch; this may be why the best dishes there seem more fresh, natural and intuitive than what’s on Mr. Carmellini's other menus."
"Phil-Am Kusina","This Filipino restaurant on the North Shore of Staten Island is run by Manny Imperial, a young chef who started working at age 5 at his parents’ grocery down the street. Portions are generous, prices kind, and the menu mostly reassuring to those unfamiliar with the cuisine."
"The Spotted Pig","April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman’s tchotchke-filled gastropub is hugely influential and enduringly popular."
"Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill","Eric and Bruce Bromberg, the brothers responsible for the Blue Ribbon brood, have brought their bold culinary eclecticism uptown and given it a large-scale setting in the 6 Columbus hotel."
"Palm Too","First-rate steakhouse food, at least if you stick to the original script of salad and tangy, prime-rated beef, or salad and massive, perfectly acceptable lobster, along with potatoes and greens."
"Cowgirl SeaHorse","An offshoot of the Cowgirl Hall of Fame, Cowgirl SeaHorse is open and fun — and a house margarita paired with warm, salty tortilla chips does much to recall the freak flagship's mood of tolerance."
"Il Posto Accanto","Il Posto Accanto, a dim, intriguing wine bar and restaurant in the East Village, has the effortless appeal of a crooked grin, a rumpled sweater and a dangling cigarette."
"Taqueria Tlaxcalli","The menu includes tacos, tortas, gorditas, sopes and molcajetes, all prepared with fidelity to the spirit of Mexico City’s taquerias."
"Blue Ribbon Sushi","If you want a traditional sushi bar, go elsewhere."
"Via Carota","Jody Williams, who shares responsibility for Via Carota’s Italian menu with Rita Sodi, has filled Via Carota with flea-market triumphs that give the dining room an ambient level of cuteness that is balanced by an Italian severity. The two chefs cook food that is deeply appealing, without mugging. Ms. Sodi is a stickler about the pastas; like the meat and fish dishes, they aren’t any more complicated than they need to be."
"Jams","The original Jams was one of the most influential restaurants of the 1980s, but this Jams reboot, inside the 1 Hotel Central Park, is stiff in the joints and short on joie de vivre."
"The Odeon","The kitchen retrenched years ago to a comfortably broken-in lineup of French and American standards. Cooking like this is sometimes called comfort food, but a better word for the menu and everything else about the Odeon is restorative."
"Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse","What happens at Sammy’s doesn’t happen at other restaurants, and vice versa. The rest of the Lower East Side can obsess over filament lightbulbs; Sammy’s, Manhattan’s last surviving Roumanian-Jewish restaurant, will be ready when fluorescents make their triumphant return to fashion. It takes you back to 1975 with a little song, a little dance and even a little seltzer."
"Lucali","Lucali is committed to finding better ingredients and better techniques, which is good news for pizza lovers."
"ABC Cocina","The menu, a collaboration of Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Dan Kluger, rummages through the cupboards of Spanish-speaking countries."
"The Harrison","Modern-American bistro food cooked with a New England accent, served in a beautiful, TriBeCa date-night room."

"Arepa Lady","For more than two decades, Maria Piedad Cano, a.k.a. the Arepa Lady, has parked her cart among the late-night roisterers of Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens. Now her arepas are available at normal waking hours, at a small restaurant."
"North End Grill","North End Grill has more focus than in its early days. Eric Korsh’s cooking can look rustic, but his embellishments betray a refined sensibility."
"Manila Social Club","Manila Social Club in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, harks back to the chef Björn DelaCruz's grandmother’s home in Davao Oriental, the Philippines, with orchids arcing from the windowsills, and nostalgia likewise suffuses the best dishes."
"Uminoie","Uminoie, a ramshackle little place in the East Village, serves an idiosyncratic blend of Japanese food cooked in the style of Goto Island."
"Deb's","Deb's is a benevolent neighborhood monarch whose flock cries out for sturdy, tasty meals that give them the strength to carry on."
"Agua Fresca","Adrian Leon introduces nontraditional ingredients and ambitious flavor combinations into the mainly Mexican menu at his snug restaurant."
"Khao Man Gai NY","Emorn Henshaw, who grew up in northeast Thailand, spent two years perfecting her recipe for khao man gai (literally translated as chicken fat rice) before she and her husband, Eric, started serving it food markets, and now this location."
"Nights and Weekends","This Havana-meets-hipster bar in Greenpoint offers Caribbean-inspired small plates and salads."
"Shabu-Tatsu","These two bright, festive and informal restaurants specialize in sukiyaki and shabu shabu, dishes that are cooked on circular metal grills set over burners in the center of each table."
"Cafe Glechik","Why not just plow through a lunch at Café Glechik, waddle down to the beach just a block away, and be done with it for rest of the day?"
"Abigail Cafe & Wine Bar","Abigail Hitchcock  and her husband, Jason Noble, who own CamaJe Bistro and Lounge in Greenwich Village, adds this spacious place to their inventory. It’s meant for casual dining but offers some dressy touches, like chandeliers, in a brick and wood setting. The menu emphasizes salads, sandwiches, small plates and children’s fare. Heartier appetites will find hanger steak and chicken."
"Jaiya","In addition to the standard Thai entrees, you'll find many vegetarian dishes and several interesting Thai soups and appetizers."
"Triomphe","The Iroquois, in the final phase of its transformation into  a chic boutique hotel, has trumped its old rival, the Algonquin: It has created a restaurant worth eating at."
"Cochinita","This little Clinton Hill taqueria is modern in aesthetic, but its reverence for Mexican street food is strictly traditional."
"Amy Ruth's","Amy Ruth's succeeds in presenting Southern food that manages to be up-to-date without sacrificing time-honored traditions."
"Peter Luger Steak House","Visits to the Peter Luger steakhouse have suggested an inconsistency at odds with its legend."
"Chumley’s","At the address of a famous former speakeasy is a restaurant that has nothing in common with the original except a name, a door, an archway and framed photographs of, and jackets of books by, writers who used to drink there. The old regulars would have taken one look at the new menu and called for another shot, but the cooking is exciting; some of it even resembles bar food."
"Dosa Garden","Helping to prove the merits of Staten Island dining, this Southern Indian standout features the deep, smoky, vibrant curries of Chettinad, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu."
"Nobu 57","Nobu 57 may not be a new dining experience, but it lives up to its place in the Nobu family of restaurants."
"Box Kite","At night, this speck of a coffee shop serves an 8-to-10-course tasting menu at a counter with creaky swivel chairs."
"Xixa","At Xixa, which opened in December in South Williamsburg, Mexico is merely a starting point for a kind of culinary free association that can be borderline loco or brilliant, sometimes both at once."
"Henry Public","A Cobble Hill pub that honors the borough’s illustrious past, with ephemera, drink names, and a &quot;bill of fare&quot; that evokes the Brooklyn of Walt Whitman."
"Caravaggio","Caravaggio is defiantly elegant in an age that sees white tablecloths as a medieval relic, and the plates are just as carefully put together."
"Aquavit","Aquavit's kitchen is soaring, with Emma Bengtsson, the chef, cooking modern Scandinavian cuisine without aping the fashionable Nordic tropes."
"Osteria Morini","A casual if riotously loud SoHo restaurant dedicated to the food and drink of Emilia-Romagna, in the north of Italy."
"Wolfgang's Steakhouse","In a battle of steakhouses, Peter Luger wins over Wolfgang's, which is partly run by a former Luger head waiter — but not by much."
"Rosa Mexicano","The decor is vibrant and the food is dull at Rosa Mexicano's Union Square location."
"Paowalla","Reaching into his back catalog, the chef Floyd Cardoz is serving some dishes and even a couple of cocktails, like the mind-clearing cucumber-gin highball called the Kachumber Cooler, that are flashbacks to the much-missed Tabla and Bread Bar."
"Murray’s Cheese Bar","Murray’s Cheese Bar stands a few doors down from its mothership, the venerable and encyclopedic Murray’s Cheese Shop, and its titular attraction comes in two forms, the perennial dichotomy of raw and cooked."
"Txikito","The talented chef Alexandra Raij focuses here on the Basque region of Spain, and the best of the food is terrific."
"Salumeria Rosi","Never mind that the neighborhood already has Fairway and Zabar’s, Cesare Casella is counting on his own edited selection of cheeses and cured meats at a retail counter to tempt those who may have nibbled them in the 35-seat cafe and Italian wine bar appended to the shop."
"Bouchon Bakery","Is Bouchon Bakery good for the Time Warner Center, an exceptional bakery and a viable choice for lunch in the neighborhood? Yes. But it is just that."
"Asian Spicy Curry","Yip Khuan Thye, a native of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, takes over the kitchen of Mama Eatery in Chinatown; the curries on the nocturnal pop-up menu are priced at $6 or $7, each a small world."
"Gotham Bar and Grill","Gotham has an informality of service that is purely American, despite the starched white tablecloths."
"The Redhead","The Redhead is a sign of these times, when distinctive food can be found in unlikely settings and when its East Village neighborhood has become a real culinary center of gravity."
"Desmond's","A society-crowded restaurant that serves mostly well-prepared haute nursery food with a vague Continental accent."
"Kopitiam","This tiny counter spot, with four stools, is a loving homage to the Malaysian kopitiam, or coffee shop, where the chef Kyo Pang, hopes to keep alive the Baba-Nyonya art of snacks, passed down by descendants of Chinese settlers along the Straits of Malacca."
"Bacaro","So-so Italianate dishes and expensive wine on the Lower East Side."
"Very Fresh Noodles","“Biang biang” is both the name of the noodles stretched to order at this cramped corner stall in Chelsea Market — straps of dough as wide as a belt, drawn out to the wingspan of their maker — and the sound of them snapping against the counter."
"Momofuku Nishi","David Chang’s alleged foray into Italian flavors takes place in an unpleasantly loud and uncomfortable room."
"Les Halles","You can hardly do better than this butcher shop and restaurant named for the old Paris market district."
"Alta","Alta is just about the smartest small-plate restaurant in New York, full of natural, unforced pleasures."
"Oriental Garden","The best dishes validate the estimation of many Chinese-Americans and food fans who consider this Chinatown's best seafood restaurant."
"Langos Truck","If you are Hungarian, this is the taste of summer: langos (pronounced LAHN-gauche), a rough disc of fried flatbread, cracker-crisp along the circumference and chewier toward the center, where it approaches gooeyness. At the Langos Truck, Zsolt Prepuk, a native of Budapest, also serves sandwiches of Mangalitsa pork sausages, in honor of the woolly Hungarian pigs bred to feed Hapsburg emperors, whose lushly marbled meat is likened to Kobe beef."
"Mamajuana Cafe","At Mamajuana Cafe, familiar Caribbean cooking gets an Inwood polish."
"Cercle Rouge","David Féau, who was the last chef at Lutèce, will open his own boutique restaurant with a raw bar and a French bistro menu."

"Rye","At Rye, which combines winning bistro classics with comforting finger food, the chef Cal Elliott shows that he has lessons to learn as a restaurateur."
"Kiki’s","Kiki's menu is littered with words like “classic,” “uncomplicated” and “childhood,” all to the good, and it is the kind of place where fresh carafes of water are plonked on the table even after the bill has been settled and you’re allowed — invited — to idle."
"Noreetuh","With prime ingredients, carefully organized plates and nonviolent prices, Noreetuh tries to tidy up Hawaiian dishes like garlic shrimp and tuna poke for their introduction to New York."
"Del Posto","A place to sit in luxury and drink Barolo, while eating food that bewilders and thrills."
"Diner","Diner was doing the Brooklyn tropes before they were Brooklyn tropes. And it still does them with charm and skill."
"Flip","New York's most comprehensive hamburger restaurant is in the basement of Bloomingdale's."
"Olmsted","Not much about the dining room sets Olmsted apart from any number of other new places to eat. But the quail coop and crayfish tub in the backyard, and the thoughtful, inventive food coming out of the tiny kitchen, tell you that hidden inside this simple and affordable neighborhood restaurant is another, more unusual one waiting to get out."
"OatMeals","If the quaint, wholesome scene is expected at OatMeals, the 30-odd variations of oatmeal are not, including bowls — sized in Baby Bear, Mama Bear and Papa Bear, of course — topped with the likes of bacon, truffle oil, coconut milk, sriracha and Gruyère."
"Pachas","The Colombian menu is what sparkles at this hybrid Colombian-Venezuelan restaurant."
"Jean-Georges","A radical reimagining of the grand style of French dining when it opened in 1997, Jean-Georges can still surprise even in its comfortable middle age."
"Radegast Hall and Biergarten","The chief draws at this beer hall in Williamsburg are its size and conviviality."
"P.J. Clarke's on the Hudson","P.J. Clarke's on the Hudson is better than snobs would like to think and worse than contrarians would hasten to claim."
"Hummus Kitchen","At this lounge-y Levantine spot, the hummus has body and a pronounced nuttiness, whether paired with chickpeas, fava beans, juicy eggplant or wild mushrooms."
"Benoit","After a shaky beginning, Alain Ducasse’s Benoit has become the most perfect fake bistro in New York."
"Buvette","Chef Jody Williams has poured decades of experience into this all-day West Village spot, where delicious is in the details."
"Lorenzo and Maria's Kitchen","Perfectly styled and glossy, this food is ready for its close-up."
"Emporium Brasil","A Brazilian restaurant in midtown."
"Knave","At Le Parker Meridien, one of the most ceremonious settings in New York for a cup of coffee."
"The Little Owl","The kitchen's care, the servers' enthusiasm and the enormous windows onto an archetypal West Village corner give the Little Owl a charm that eclipses its shortcomings."
"Raclette","At this tiny storefront, the melting surface of great half-wheels of raclette cheese is scraped down tableside over a plate of cornichons, pickled pearl onions, roasted potatoes and thin, purplish-red slices of air-dried beef. It is deeply satisfying to watch the cascade of cheese and to dig out the vegetables and meat below, as if eating fondue in reverse."
"Porchetta","Pork loin is wrapped in pork belly with fennel pollen, garlic, sage, rosemary and fistfuls of salt and pepper and roasted for five hours in a combi oven that has locked in their moisture."
"Northeast Kingdom","Northeast Kingdom is a modest and charming spot housed in a one-story building surrounded by blocks of factories and warehouses."

"Cafe Kristall","The chef Kurt Gutenbrunner’s jewel-box cafe has been remade with décor that is decidedly Viennese and a menu that smacks with Austrian authority."
"San Pietro","If they know you, and you are lucky, the food in this cozy restaurant can be fabulous."
"The Hideaway","The Hideaway in TriBeCa isn’t famous for whisper-smooth cocktails or brandy snifters; instead, it’s the basic neighborhood bar of a food-lover’s dreams."
"Bergen Hill","In the tiny kitchen of this small, vaguely old-timey establishment, Andrew D’Ambrosi turns out sophisticated and often surprising plates of seafood."
"Havana NY","The food here is typically robust, flavored with lusty doses of garlic and lime, yet it can be delicate, too."
"Hill Country Barbecue Market","This is a state-of-the-art Manhattan homage to the pre-industrial craft of Texas barbecue, particularly as it is practiced in the town of Lockhart."
"Han Bat","This informal round-the-clock restaurant specializes in Korean country food."
"Bonsignour","Just the sort of place to visit when food becomes boring."
"Hançi","A modest Turkish restaurant on the northern frontier of Hell’s Kitchen with straightforward cooking."
"Little Pepper","The chefs excel at bringing the fiery flavors of Sichuan cuisine into balance with sweet, salty and sour ones."
"Woodside Cafe","Woodside Cafe was once a mostly Italian, partly Nepalese restaurant, opened by a native of Kathmandu who spent 14 years cooking Italian food on the Upper East Side. Now the only trace of the Mediterranean is a pink sauce of tomatoes and heavy cream ladled over momos, Himalayan dumplings."
"Shake Shack","Among the most influential restaurants of the past decade, Shake Shack has been studied and copied around the country. But success has also bred a higher class of competition."
"Naka Naka","Unlike some other new restaurants  in the post-meatpacking sprawl north of 14th Street, Naka Naka doesn¹t  humble diners with fields of marble flooring, modish design schemes or stanchions strung with velvet."
"Racines NY","Racines NY is a branch of one of Paris’s most influential wine bars. It has very little in common with the original, but it has virtues of its own."
"Gottino","It is hard to call Gottino a wine bar -- it's got much too much food, of much too much merit, for eating to be deemed the ancillary activity here."
"Taste of Northern China","At this small storefront under the Manhattan Bridge, the menu draws a wide map, from smoky, salty skewers with the flavors of Xinjiang, China’s Wild West; to gluten noodles with sesame paste and vinegar from Shaanxi; and beef noodle soup underscored by doubanjiang, in the Sichuan style."
"Waldy's Wood-Fired Pizza & Penne","The toppings at Waldy's are the good news; the crust disappoints."
"Lupulo","George Mendes’s basic idea for Lupulo was straightforward enough. The place is his take on the beer-centered Portuguese taverns called cervejarias. Much of the menu gets right into the beery spirit, with food that’s left a little rough around the edges."
"Sip Sak","If you know what to ask for at Sip Sak, you can have a superbly flavorful, satisfying experience."
"Cascabel Taqueria","Every night is spring break at Cascabel Taqueria, where simpler (carnitas or carne asada tacos) is better."
"Pizza Moto @ John Grace Bakery","A pizzeria in the Brooklyn-Neapolitan tradition exemplified by Roberta’s and Franny’s, Pizza Moto makes excellent use of a restored oven."
"Kombit","At Kombit, food is homey and affordable, and those new to Haitian food could not ask for a better introduction."
"Eat","The food is still true to the aesthetic of this former used-record store in Greenpoint."
"Tacos Matamoros","Tacos Matamoros makes some of the best tacos to be had in New York."
"The Meatball Shop","This meatball specialist on the Lower East Side offers the signature fare in a half-dozen flavors and all sorts of permutations."
"Shimizu Sushi","Shimizu, a small, serene Japanese restaurant on the edge of the theater district, is a worthy stop for anyone who appreciates first-rate sushi and tempura and happens to be nearby."
"Bark Hot Dogs","Bark Hot Dogs takes a fearless leap into the ever-closing gap between artisan chic and fast food."
"This Little Piggy Had Roast Beef","The Staten Islanders from the popular Artichoke Pizza and Led Zeppole serve up just a few beef sandwiches and a few sides at this sliver of a spot in the East Village."
"Hummus Place","At New York's pioneer hummus parlor, decked out in warm yellow and burgundy, the signature dish is eerily smooth and seamless in taste, the sesame and the garlic having reached a state of equilibrium."
"River Cafe","No place in the city combines spectacle with hideaway intimacy and undiluted romance the way the River Café does."
"Tacombi at Fonda Nolita","Tacombi @ Fonda Nolita brings a Yucatán beach-shack vibe to the skinny-jeans crowd."
"Charlie Bird","Charlie Bird has the slightly-too-crowded and slightly-too-loud spirit that keeps people living in New York, even while they gripe about it. But at its best it masters an eager-to-please Italian mode that leans heavily on cheese, salt and crunch."
"Kulushkät","The falafel at this modest and mostly takeout shop in Park Slope is crisp yet moist, airy yet creamy."
"The Dutch","An aggressively American restaurant from, among others, the French-trained Italian-cooking, world-larder-beating chef Andrew Carmellini."
"Gotham West Market","With an unusual degree of imagination, Gotham West smartly stakes out a middle ground between the star power that packs Eataly and the hope of discovery that drives small-business proving grounds like Smorgasburg."
"The Marrow","The two trunks of Harold Dieterle’s family tree are stamped on his menu: Famiglia Chiarelli on the left, with the polenta and the fettucine; on the right, with sauerkraut and schnitzel, Familie Dieterle."
"The John Dory Oyster Bar","A maddening no-reservations policy makes it difficult for anyone who doesn’t have time or young legs to stand around waiting for a table, but the food is incredibly good."
"STK","Slick, dark, noisy and in need of a vowel, STK blurs the line between restaurant and nightclub; in other words, it's in the meatpacking district."
"Ca Va Todd English","Large and impersonal, this restaurant at the InterContinental Hotel serves an English translation of traditional bistro food."
"Montmartre","The pot au pho and other French-Asian fusion dishes at Montmartre often have more conviction than the straight-up French food of many other New York bistros."
"Bistro le Steak","The moderately priced steak and other simple bistro specialties are consistently satisfying at this warm and informal neighborhood restaurant."
"Monkey Bar","No longer clubby and exclusive, Monkey Bar has become a welcoming oasis for adults."
"Mimi","It’s an updated version of the small French restaurant everybody dreams of finding in the Village. The kitchen is small and still figuring things out, but it has a clear vision of French food as a celebration of appetite, an occasion to eat with joy and lust."
"Blue Hill","The chef Dan Barber is a dirt poet and kitchen philosopher whose time with the pigs and the beans has had a deep, lasting effect on the way he cooks; New York City does not afford the time or space for the leisurely unfurling of Mr. Barber’s complete vision, but Blue Hill is still an exceptional restaurant."
"Littleneck","This cute, shipshape seafood shack near Brooklyn’s Gowanus Canal serves clams raw, steamed, in a chowder, and in a roll, sometimes to tasty effect."
"Cafe Kiev","This family-run Ukrainian cafe is cheerier and more welcoming than many of the banquet facilities and dingy holes-in-the-wall serving cuisines of the former Soviet Union."
"Max SoHa","Home-style Italian with few frills and no luxuries, other than delicious buffalo-milk mozzarella and a superior list of moderately priced wines."
"Zizi Limona","Zizi Limona, which opened in Williamsburg in September, cultivates an air of unhurry, and as for the name, it is happy nonsense, invented by the owners, veterans of Middle Eastern establishments in Manhattan who wanted to be free of culinary or geographic limitation."
"Mable’s Smokehouse","Mable's brings the smoky style of Oklahoma City barbecue to Williamsburg."
"All'onda","At All'onda, it’s as if an Italian menu had a raging crush on Japan and couldn’t stop bringing it up in conversation."
"Gastronomia Culinaria","Gastronomia Culinaria feels true to a certain type of small Roman trattoria where the food is plain-spoken and the pricing temperate."
"Contra","Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske have a personal, understated, modern approach to deeply seasonal cooking."
"Beach Bistro 96","Carlos Vallera, who grew up in the Brazilian port town Santos, opened this low-slung sea shack a block from Rockaway Beach after another life as a pro surfer and model."
"Giuseppina","A simple corner restaurant with ties to Lucali in nearby Carroll Gardens and good brick-oven pizza."
"Taste of Persia NYC","At Taste of Persia NYC, a takeout counter tucked into a utilitarian pizzeria on 18th Street, Saeed Pourkay serves his justly fabled ash reshteh, a wondrous, wintry, outrageously thick Persian soup, along with rustic stews that have been simmered for hours."
"Chez Sardine","Chez Sardine offers the kind of izakaya where a bite-size piece of hamachi sushi is crunchy with fried pork rinds, and where sashimi is slipped in among a stack of flapjacks."
"Coals","Coals is unlike any other pizza place in the Bronx--or in the rest of the city, for that matter. The pies it slings are not coal oven, wood oven or oven baked at all. They are grilled."
"Sam’s Spring Roll","Here, a spring roll might hide the soft heart of an Indian samosa, or reveal an interior of ground chicken perfumed with cumin, a borrowing from northwestern China, and the sauces — including a voluptuous chimichurri mellowed by Greek yogurt and a nervy synthesis of fishy sauce, cilantro, garlic and Thai bird chiles — redeem even wayward experiments at Sam's Spring Roll."
"Hakkasan New York","This multimillion-dollar exercise in Orientalism off Times Square is the seventh in a global chain started in London."
"606 R & D","Playful, modern food, seriously good, with a soft spot for childhood snacks and seasonal produce."
"Colonie","With a handsome bar in front and a sepia-toned, brick-walled dining room in back, this restaurant serves a mostly solid farm-to-table menu of haute American food."
"Hirohisa","Hirohisa is a kappo-style restaurant, a form of Japanese dining in which the chef makes both hot and cold dishes behind a counter."
"Onegin","Big and over the top like the palatial Russian restaurants of Brighton Beach, but it offers few of their pleasures."
"Lhasa Fast Food","The cooking at Lhasa Fast Food — cauldrons of dusky broths, heavy with hand-torn scraps of dough and humming with Sichuan peppercorns; momos looking ready to burst their pleats — would be worth seeking out even if it were served in a sleek food hall in Midtown Manhattan."
"Lupa","Lupa has long been a destination for the simple but delicious preparations of Lazio, the region of Italy centered around Rome."
"Lucky Strike","Frenchish food, lots of models."
"Great Northern Food Hall","There’s something utopian about the notion that even a hasty, inconsequential meal, gobbled on a train or at a desk, can be — should be — fresh and good. That’s the mission of this impeccably polished food hall, opened in Grand Central Terminal by the Danish restaurateur Claus Meyer, a founder of Noma, in Copenhagen, and a prime mover in defining New Nordic cuisine."
"Morandi","Having played with French conceits at Balthazar and Pastis, the restaurateur Keith McNally turns to Italian ones at Morandi, where he teams up with the talented chef Jody Williams."
"Soba Totto","At Soba Totto, couples should opt for the yakitori bar, where there's plenty of elbow room and the opportunity to watch the cooks tend to skewers."
"Lavo","An Italian restaurant serving large portions, set above a nightclub on East 58th Street."
"Bago","Almost everything is under $10 at Bago, a modest Filipino restaurant in the East Village where dishes are cooked to order and brought to your table or counter."
"Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria","This sibling to the original Il Buco, on Bond Street, is the city’s most complete realization so far of a powerful myth: the simple and convivial restaurant that tastes just like Italy."
"Kum Gang San","Good for Korean barbecue; open all night."
"Sessanta","A polished and urbane setting, more negroni than chianti, where the kitchen draws on the cooking of southern Italy."
"Vivolo","This venerable Italian restaurant in an East Side town house presents several dining options, including a comfortable dining room, a quicker, more casual cafe, and a takeout service."
"La Tarte Flambée","La Tarte Flambée aspires to the spirit of a traditional Alsatian winstub, or tavern, minus the checkered tablecloths."
"Bread","If you're going to call your Café Bread, the bread had better be really good. On that score, this little Italian Café does not disappoint."
"Patroon","At a renovated Patroon, the doorman is gone, the cigar bar is history and, on the menu, simplicity rules."
"La Fonda del Sol","The Spanish food coming out of a kitchen run by Josh DeChellis is surely executed and, more often than not, very appealing."
"Monument Lane","Pork potpie, sautéed brown trout and lobster rolls in a setting that evokes an early American tavern."
"Il Cantinori","The room is attractive, but prices are high and the food is uneven."
"Hanamizuki","At this Japanese cafe, the rice balls (onigiri or omusubi in Japanese) are slightly offbeat, as if sprung from a Haruki Murakami novel. The menu is designed mostly for snacking."
"Cho Dang Gol","Small and spare, this attractive restaurant features dishes with the tofu made daily on the premises."
"The Mercer Kitchen","Mercer Kitchen occupies a sexy underground space with a darkness that flatters the food as well as the diners. The food needs it."
"Miyagi","The biggest thing about Miyagi is the menu, which has many familiar choices and just enough offbeat selections to keep things interesting."
"La Grenouille","Gorgeous flowers, fine service, rich people and a menu written entirely in French."
"Joe's Ginger","Joe's Ginger in Chinatown offers Sichuan-style food with a nod to Hong Kong tastes."
"Max Brenner, Chocolate by the Bald Man","At the East Village chocolatier Max Brenner, many of the confections aren’t as rich as great chocolate can be and the regular food isn’t especially appealing either."
"Second Avenue Deli","To eat at the new Second Avenue Deli is to pass through a communal storehouse of memories, on a bridge of babkas from the past to the future."
"Cherry","It is hard not to feel vexed at Cherry, which promises so much and proves such a tease."
"Lulu & Po","On a residential corner of Fort Greene, a brisk 10 minutes from the nearest subway and two ill-lighted blocks north of the restaurants clustered on DeKalb Avenue, Lulu & Po feels hidden."
"Bistro SK","Bistro SK is an improbably authentic and intimate French bistro in a remote nautical enclave of the Bronx."
"An Choi","The culinary thrill of Vietnamese streetside dining combined with the camaraderie of a Lower East Side hangout."
"L'Absinthe","Chef Jean-Michel Bergougnoux makes some of the city's best old-fashioned food; unfortunately if you are not a regular customer, it is served with a dose of attitude."
"Hot Kitchen","The word “hot” does not adequately convey the seemingly infinite shades of heat that ripple through this small, unpretentious Sichuanese restaurant, a minimalist canteen in whitewashed brick and red beams that is closer in geography and spirit to N.Y.U. than Chinatown."
"Toloache","Despite its strange purple facade, this Mexican bistro is worth a second look."
"Spicy Lanka","The menu for this Sri Lankan restaurant is terse and cryptic; best just to ask for recommendations, like pittu, squat columns of roasted rice flour, steamed with pandan leaves and adorned with icing-white curls of coconut."
"Risotteria","Although Risotteria also offers a wide selection of panini and salads, its namesake is its standout dish. And you can take it with you."
"The Moxie Spot","A Chuck E. Cheese for hipsters in brownstone Brooklyn."
"Almayass","Family values set the tone for the whole experience of eating at Almayass."
"BLVD Bistro","Carlos Swepson, a New York chef with roots in Natchez, Miss., is not reinventing the Southern-food wheel, but he is trying to make it a smoother ride. His best food — like wood-smoked chicken, crisp wild grouper with a cornmeal crust, and exemplary Southern potato salad (with chopped hard-boiled eggs) — is pressed right up against tradition, but tweaked for modern taste."
"Perla","Perla serves a swaggering, red-blooded version of Italian food in a space designed to look like it's been around for decades."
"Acme","One of the founding chefs of Noma in Copenhagen treats familiar ingredients with an uncommon gentleness and respect."
"La Morada","La Morada’s married owners, Natalia Mendez and Antonio Saavedra, were once farmers in Oaxaca, which is one of the poorest states in Mexico but whose cuisine is among the country’s richest. While much of the menu is taken up by tacos and quesadillas, a few dishes offer a glimpse of the “infinite gastronomy” that is Oaxacan cooking."
"No. 7 Sub","At this takeout shop, a Manhattan offshoot of the venturesome Brooklyn restaurant No. 7, sandwiches are stuffed with disparate ingredients, with delicious results."
"Pulqueria","Small plates Mexican style, with tequila-laced drinks."
"Paradou","Paradou is a panini shop born of a different Mediterranean coast where the specialty is 'sandwichs grillés,' as they would say in Provence."
"Piora","Chris Cipollone’s cooking dips into Korean cuisine, but before you file it under Asian fusion, be aware that the one thing you must do at Piora is eat some pasta."
"Loreley","Loreley, an urban beer garden, has a simple but satisfying menu."
"ABV Wine Bar","Childhood nostalgia, machismo, plus a dash of stick-it-to-the-man: this pretty much sums up the attitude behind ABV Wine Bar. ABV’s take on comfort food that is less reinvention than merry spree, artisanal ingredients and avant-garde technique in service of the munchies."
"Empellón Cocina","Alex Stupak’s mash note to the food of Mexico resembles its inspiration the way dreams resemble life."
"Convivium Osteria","Much but not all of the time, Convivium, which has the spirit of a particularly fine neighborhood place, serves satisfying food."
"Tempura Matsui","A serene Japanese cloister serving no-choice kaiseki-style menus."
"Houseman","You don’t taste Houseman’s food in politely appreciative nibbles, you throw yourself at it until there’s nothing left. No menu layout can convey this quality, but when you find a restaurant that has it, you come back."
"Indian Accent","A Midtown branch of an acclaimed restaurant in New Delhi, Indian Accent feeds the desire to see traditional cuisine twisted, bent and played with."
"No. 7","No. 7 is a comfortable restaurant with comfortable prices, but instead of comfort food it does big-city, night-on-the-town chef food."
"The Lambs Club","A clubbish and warm restaurant in the lobby of the Chatwal Hotel that is a kind of Sardi’s for the modern age."
"Khe-Yo","Khe-Yo tentatively introduces New Yorkers to the food of Laos, which has been largely missing from the city."
"Petrossian Cafe And Boutique","Freshness is paramount at this cafe and bakery."
"Zoma","The modish, minimalist décor tips you off that things are a little different at Zoma, an Ethiopian restaurant just north of Central Park."
"The Park","When there's a 30-foot tree in the center of the dining room, you get the feeling that food is not the main thing."
"Crazy Crab 888","Crazy Crab 888 is a former bodega turned Burmese-Yunnanese-Malaysian-Thai restaurant and aspiring Cajun crab shack."
"Nix","Liberated from the ideologies of vegetarianism, Nix is free to pursue the hedonic values of vegetables."
"Ay Kitchen","The Turkish tastes at this Murray Hill restaurant range from bold (pan-fried calf’s liver, kofte, tarama) to a bit too mild (unspicy “spicy"" chicken adana kebabs, bland octopus or white bean salads)."
"Mermaid Inn Uptown","A reasonably good seafood restaurant in the East Village, the Mermaid Inn is frustratingly mediocre in its uptown location."
"Aperitivo","Wood-burning ovens fire up pizzas of varied geometry and toppings, plus the restaurant offers a broader Italian menu."
"Palm","First-rate steakhouse food, at least if you stick to the original script of salad and tangy, prime-rated beef, or salad and massive, perfectly acceptable lobster, along with potatoes and greens."
"Joe","Joe, which has a handful of branches around town, makes a macchiato that is a work of art."
"Kum Gang San","Good for Korean barbecue; open all night."
"Donguri","Unlike the many Japanese restaurants in Manhattan that treat food as one of many props in a broader theatrical production, Donguri focuses your attention squarely on what's on the plate."
"Pylos","Pylos is a conscientious ambassador of Greek cooking and a standout among Manhattan's Greek restaurants."
"Plaza Xochimilco","The cooks at Xochimilco go full-tilt with their taco garnishes: onions, cilantro, tomato and a generous smear of creamy guacamole."
"High Street on Hudson","Serious and creative all day long, High Street on Hudson understands that coffee and a great pastry can be just as meaningful before noon as an artfully plated duck breast is after dark."
"The Smoke Joint","Southern.  Barbecue."
"La Chine","Chinese cooking with generally excellent ingredients in preparations that climb the slopes of creativity."
"Jones Wood Foundry","The mission to convince New Yorkers that British food is delicious continues at this cheeky, food-driven gastropub."
"Osteria del Circo","It's hard to think of a restaurant that works harder at fun than Osteria del Circo, but ultimately, the food is nothing special.

delivery and takeout via seamlessweb.com ONLY."
"Barraca","At Barraca, his casual new tapas spot in the West Village, what you see is what you get."
"Lucky Luna","At Lucky Luna, a Mexican-Taiwanese restaurant, you'll find posole and tacos, congee and steamed bao buns. The excitement lies in unexpected details, like a house-made hot sauce that starts off Chinese, with a hit of vinegar, and finishes Mexican, with a swaggering heat."
"Yama","The trend is downhill for this highly popular and formerly excellent Japanese restaurant."
"Marea","The latest jewel in the crown of Chris Cannon and chef Michael White, Marea has a menu probably best described as coastal."
"Amáli","Amáli was once Persephone, a haute Greek restaurant in the stoic Upper East Side mode."
"Lucien","This crowded, smoky, somewhat disheveled little French place serves old-fashioned homey meals."
"Semilla","Semilla’s chef, José Ramírez-Ruiz, and pastry chef, Pam Yung, stack their tasting menus with dishes that weren’t concocted to please the marketplace. Diners browse extensively upon stems, tubers, rhizomes, seeds and other plant parts, yet this isn’t a vegetarian restaurant."
"Caffébene","The first American outpost of one of South Korea’s largest coffee chains proves that high-quality coffee can be executed on a large scale."
"Khao Kang","At Khao Kang, there is no menu or wait service. Food is premade and presented cafeteria style."
"Han Dynasty","Han Chiang’s chain of Sichuan restaurants has been so popular in and around Philadelphia that Mr. Chiang plans to open 100 locations around the country. There are quite a few towns where this would be great news, but Manhattan has far better Sichuan kitchens."
"The Mark Restaurant by Jean-Georges","From the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, a simple two-star restaurant for a neighborhood that doesn’t want to be pushed too hard in any one direction."
"Apiary","Ligne Roset, the French furniture company, co-owns this restaurant with Jenny Moon, who worked at Daniel and Tabla."
"Il Buco","Il Buco has put much effort, if not more, into creating a Mediterranean menu as beguiling as its antiques-strewn dining room."
"Tres Carnes","It's an alluringly simple idea: Take some Lone Star-quality barbecue and put it into tacos and burritos. You’ll encounter an abundance of sides and fillings as you make your way down the Chipotle-style assembly line."
"Market Table","What makes Market Table work are precisely those attributes supposedly prized most in anxious times. What makes it special is how expertly it embodies them."
"Santina","From the team behind Dirty French and Carbone, an Italian ode to eternal sunshine inside a glass-box building under the High Line."
"Cafe SFA","This large airy room is a blessing for the weary legs and bag-laden arms at Saks Fifth Avenue."
"Al Safa","An unassuming Lebanese restaurant in Bay Ridge."
"Chomp Chomp","Like going from hawker stall to hawker stall without leaving your seat."
"Kajitsu","Kajitsu practices an animal-free cooking tradition called shojin-ryori that was developed in Zen Buddhist monasteries over many centuries."
"Untitled","Although the restaurant is on the ground floor of the Whitney Museum of American Art, it is resolutely uninterested in arty food."
"Landmarc","Nothing about Landmarc is high concept, but the restaurant proves that simple, competent cooking goes a long way."
"At Vermilion","It's interesting that Indian and Latin American cuisines share some key flavors — tamarind, lime, cumin, chilies, mango — but not interesting enough to sustain at At Vermilion."
"Mo Gridder's BBQ","Barbecued ribs are supposed to be meat, not pablum, and the crew at Mo Gridder's gets that."
"Hell's Kitchen","The chef Sue Torres specializes in creatively using Mexican flavorings and cooking techniques."
"Aldea","The chef George Mendes and Aldea, his Portuguese restaurant, are unusually ambidextrous, as comfortable whipping up ethereal foams as scattering hunks of pork anywhere they can be defensibly scattered."
"Per Se","Thomas Keller’s grand, hermetic restaurant offers a protracted march of dishes, including several classics that are sometimes exquisite."
"Foragers City Table","Foragers City Table, which opened in April, is an annex to the boutique market Foragers City Grocer. Both are offshoots of Foragers Market in Dumbo, Brooklyn, which subscribes to the credo of local sourcing and sustainability."
"Balaboosta","Einat Admony’s charming and casual Middle Eastern trattoria with Israeli roots near the top end of Little Italy."
"Salvation Burger","At Salvation Burger, the chef April Bloomfield zeroes in on what the people want and dispenses with almost everything else; three of the five main courses are burgers, and all five come on a bun."
"Royal Seafood Restaurant","Royal Seafood has glinting chandeliers and the added benefit of serving food that is often very close to Cantonese cuisine, the original flavor of Chinatown, with enough modern Hong Kong flourishes to let you know that it’s 2012."
"Gemma","Gemma, in the ultra-fashionable Bowery Hotel, is a cheat sheet of an Italian restaurant."
"Quality Italian","A kind of clone of Quality Meats, a block away, with some Italian-American food grafted on for good measure, it is the restaurant that finally answers the question “What if we set lobster fra diavolo on fire?”"
"Aska","Over the past several years, few chefs have grown into their ambitions as dramatically and successfully as Aska’s, Fredrik Berselius. Aska, beneath the ribs of the Williamsburg Bridge in July, is his third restaurant; with each fresh incarnation, his modern Scandinavian, nature-boy cooking has taken a leap forward."
"Bon Chon","The New York flagship of a Korean chain that specializes in fried chicken."
"Ed’s Lobster Bar Kiosk","At six ounces of lobster meat, the flotilla-sized signature Ed’s roll is hard to sink, but the setting couldn’t be more pleasant."
"Harry Cipriani","After two-year renovation, the dining room gleams as brightly as ever, but the cooking is ordinary or careless for the most part, and the service is often confused."
"Mr. K's","The food is utterly unfrightening, even for those who have a fear of chopsticks."
"Gimme! Coffee","Gimme! Coffee has been counted among the city’s best coffee bars since it arrived in New York in 2003."
"Char No. 4","The name refers to the burn in a barrel for aging bourbon, one style of more than 150 American whiskeys poured with Southern-accented food in this spot."
"Thai Market","A blend of traditional and new, Thai Market conjures up Bangkok."
"Employees Only","Billed as an old New York speakeasy, Employees Only has stealthily Balkanized its menu."
"Peasant","When the formula works, Peasant sends out highly satisfying food, fresh and flavorful, with the rich tanginess that wood smoke imparts."
"Il Salumaio","Il Salumaio turns out satisfyingly nostalgic Italian fare."
"Café Altro Paradiso","A fantasy on the theme of a simple Italian cafe; the food can look and sound ordinary, but is often anything but."
"Union Square Cafe","In late 2009, as it closed in on the quarter century mark, Union Square's performance wasn't quite keeping pace with its favor, and the transcendent geniality of its atmosphere couldn't obscure moment-to-moment lapses in service and in cooking."
"Rôtisserie Georgette","If Rotisserie Georgette had a clock, its hands would be stopped at five minutes before nouvelle cuisine, when meat was carved to cover the plate and sauce came on the side and nobody turned down potatoes."
"Ground Support","Well-crafted espresso drinks in an airy SoHo space."
"Perbacco","With the arrival of a new chef, Simone Bonelli, in April 2008, the small Italian restaurant Perbacco ascended to a whole new level, worthy of its name, which means 'wow.'"
"Superiority Burger","New ideas fly through Superiority Burger’s kitchen so quickly you can almost hear them buzz by, which is what elevates the place above what it appears to be at first glance, a Shake Shack for vegetarians."
"Bite of Hong Kong","The trappings are classic at this Cantonese restaurant, and the menu is at once too vast and too pithy, but if you study it long enough, you will find dishes that speak to both the elegance and motley of eating in Hong Kong."
"Sido","These two Middle Eastern takeout shops offer fine vegetarian dishes."
"Falafel House","A tasty and trim little takeout shop on the Upper East Side."
"Tsukushi","Tsukushi's chef, Norihiko Manabe, has a real talent for orchestrating a meal."
"Momoya","This Japanese restaurant doesn't aim big, but it aims prudently and pleasingly."
"Pascalou","This likable neighborhood restaurant offers well-prepared French and Italian dishes."
"La Nacional","La Nacional can be frustratingly quirky, but when the platter of paella arrives, everything seems all right."
"Bond 45","This big, blunt restaurant has the look of a well-aged brasserie and features a vast antipasto and an encyclopedic menu."
"Onieal's Soho","Great looks, decent food and a smoker's paradise."
"Punjab","This is the 17-year-old satellite location of a bigger and older curry-in-a-hurry operation in eastern Queens."
"M. Wells Steakhouse","Discipline is not the strong suit of M. Wells Steakhouse, for better and for worse."
"Salvation Taco","This jammed and noisy restaurant inside the Pod, a new hotel in Murray Hill, offers small tacos in tortillas slightly bigger than an English muffin."
"Totto Ramen","A simple noodle shop."
"Mile End","A loving tribute to the deli tradition, whose guilty, cholesterol-laden pleasures are uplifted here with first-class ingredients."
"Betony","Bryce Shuman, the chef of Betony, worked under Daniel Humm at Eleven Madison Park for six years, and traces of Mr. Humm’s style show up in his cooking."
"Carbone","Carbone is a fancy red-sauce joint as directed by Quentin Tarantino."
"ABC Kitchen","A winsome sprawl on the ground floor of ABC Carpet & Home, created by Jean-Georges Vongerichten, that is haute organic."
"The Waverly Inn",""
"Caffe Vivaldi","Open for late-night java lovers and diners as well, Caffe Vivaldi serves a light menu."
"Da Umberto","The restaurant was more appealing when Tuscan was rare and Chelsea was exotic."
"Las Ramblas","Las Ramblas looks more like a tapas bar in Spain than much of its competition here in the city."
"Go! Go! Curry","Go! Go! Curry, the first American incursion of a chain peddling Japanese curry, features a short roster of toppings to complement a thick slick of dark curry sauce atop a pile of rice the size of a pitcher’s mound."
"Virgil's Real BBQ","Virgil's is full of show biz artifice, but the appreciation of barbecue is sincere, and the food is pretty good."
"Guh Song","Among the many Korean-Chinese restaurants that dot Queens. The jjajangmyun is particularly well done with a deeply flavored sauce."
"Africa Kine","Samba Niang and Kine (pronounced kee-nay) Mar, natives of Dakar, run this Senegalese restaurant in Harlem, where by day, women cook crowded, fragrant stews, primed with fermented dried fish and sea snail; men roast monuments of meat by night."
"Rocking Horse Cafe","With sharper flavors and a restoration of the clear tie to Mexican regional cooking, Rocking Horse has regained its footing."
"Joy Burger Bar","Joy is a sweet hangout for the best patty for blocks."
"Chinatown Brasserie","Chinatown Brasserie fuses refined versions of diners' favorite Chinese dishes with a recognizably hip stage that is not, for the most part, too tricked out.

Can order for takeout or delivery on seamlessweb.com."
"Miss Lily’s Bakeshop & Melvin’s Juice Box","A cheerful spot that’s part diner, part beachfront snack shack: a handful of tables, some bar stools at a counter, a pair of benches set outside."
"Ganso","Ganso is half-hidden on a bland tangent off the Fulton Street Mall in Downtown Brooklyn, at a midpoint between Armani Exchange and IHOP."
"Alimentos Saludables","This Mexican diner serves some of the best tamales in town, slapped on a paper plate and trussed in corn husks still damp with steam. Unshucked, they seem almost to breathe. The dough is soft and marbled with sauce, so that a little finds its way into every bite. Concepción Gonzalez, the chef, who started out selling tamales in front of a nearby church, is an efficient, motherly presence. A statue of baby Jesus in gold robes gazes pacifically from a glass case; Héctor Acosta might be singing merengue on the jukebox. The menu lists five varieties of tamales, most of which will be sold out by dinnertime, so come early."
"Sushi Nakazawa","The moment-to-moment joys of eating one mouthful of sushi after another can merge into a blur of fish bliss. But almost everything Daisuke Nakazawa cups in his hands and places in front of you is an event on its own."
"Sky Cafe","Lily Tjia started cooking, semi-secretly, for her neighbors in the growing Indonesian community of South Philadelphia. In 2010 she opened a restaurant in that city; four year later, she moved to Elmhurst, Queens, and opened another."
"Meskel Ethiopian Restaurant","Meskel Ethiopian serves meat, but their vegetable dishes are the best thing to happen to East Village vegetarians in a long time."
"Nightingale 9","The chef, Robert Newton — who was born in Arkansas and runs the Southern restaurant Seersucker a few doors down — borrows flavors across a distance, finding resonances between the cooking of Vietnam and that of his heritage."
"Asiate","At Asiate, the view and design outweigh the the food of Nori Sugie, whose cooking seems to have gotten muddled in the rarefied air."
"Bar Bolonat","The white napkins, polished stemware, sheer curtains and understated modern furniture at Bar Bolonat are all a determined bid for the kinds of diners who would steer clear of anything resembling a hummus hut. Energetic seasoning drives the cuisine, and can be seen in dishes like shrimp in a Yemenite curry, with a fiery shot of green zhug and a small round of fried bread called malawa to soak up the spicy, turmeric-gold coconut milk."
"Cafe Cluny","Cafe Cluny trades the swagger of a brasserie for the intimacy of a bistro."
"Gazala Place","Gazala Halabi makes pita and other baked goods on a saag griddle. The best way to get a taste of Druse cuisine is to order a platter of appetizers for the table and share it."
"Ambassador Grill & Lounge","Near the United Nations and popular with diplomats."
"Rucola","This Boerum Hill restaurant does the neighborhood proud with flavorful renditions of Northern Italian dishes."
"Strip House","Strip House is not so much a steakhouse as a catalog of hip references to the idea of a steakhouse, a kind of restaurant that really has no natural place in the heart of Greenwich Village."
"Souvlaki GR","Whitewashed walls and Aegean blue shutters invoke the Cyclades by way of the Lower East Side."
"Bouley","The baronial dining room and the lushness of David Bouley’s cooking make this a restaurant for sensualists and romantics."
"Motorino","Motorino pies are great hot out of the oven, five minutes later, 10."
"Taiwan Bear House","At Taiwan Bear House in Chinatown, biodegradable wooden boxes are packed with rice and topped with crusty pork chop, slabs of pork belly or chicken twice fried in the night-market style."
"Eataly","A retail love letter to Italy, with food stalls galore and five restaurants."
"Crêpes Canaveral","At this takeout stand the size of a carnival ticket booth, Jean-Christophe Henry makes Breton crepes from a family recipe that dates back to the late 19th century, and he encourages customers to eat inside the adjacent William Barnacle Tavern, to which Crêpes Canaveral is attached, a low-key, Celtic-leaning bar that was once the taproom of a Prohibition-era speakeasy and still looks it."
"Hatsuhana","Real connoisseurs sit at the downstairs sushi bar."
"Yaso Tangbao","Nearly everything on the menu at this informal restaurant summons up the streets of Shanghai, from the giant shaggy pork-belly meatballs called lion's heads, majestic and mystifyingly airy, to volcanic soup dumplings from a chef who made his name at the first Joe's Shanghai in Flushing, Queens."
"Smith & Mills","There's a place in any diner's arsenal for a nook like Smith & Mills, where the food takes a backseat to the lighting, the drinks flow freely and meals proceed at a leisurely pace."
"Pera Mediterranean Brasserie","Pera honors the Turkish culinary spirit. Its $46 meal of family-style platters of kebabs, along with tiny Turkish-style pizzas and an array of mezes, is a winner, though diners who stray to other areas of an uneven menu risk disappointment or at least boredom."
"Pilar Cuban Eatery","This tiny Cuban eatery on the border of Clinton Hill and Bedford-Stuyvesant turns out homey but complexly flavored food."
"Dakshin","It was a great pleasure to find lively spicing deliciously apparent in more than a few dishes at Dakshin."
"Chevalier","There is a lot to enjoy on Shea Gallante's menu at the ""brasserie de luxe"" Chevalier, but the restaurant is probably not meant for anybody who's in the habit of reading over the check before signing it."
"New Wonjo Restaurant","The food is lively and fresh at this Koreatown standby, from the banchan to the spicy cold noodles with egg and beef."
"Land Thai Kitchen","Land Thai Kitchen serves Thai food that is accessible, affordable, never greasy and on occasion interesting."
"Luke's Lobster","Barely bound, smartly spiced lobster rolls with meat plucked fresh from Maine waters."
"La Maison Du Chocolat","The prized confection at this dessert shop is the bittersweet bouche."
"The NoMad","The NoMad in the NoMad Hotel is operated by the same duo who run Eleven Madison Park in New York, and with this restaurant, they have done something rather novel and wonderful."
"Saltie","A tiny sandwich shop where breads are baked in-house and the dessert case is filled with 10 or more different pastries."
"Cafe Boulud","The former Daniel became casual and turned into a cafe — but what a cafe."
"El Papasito","A midtown Dominican restaurant."
"Laut","Hiding behind a pan-Asian menu is some of the best Malaysian food in Manhattan."
"HanYang BunSik","HanYang BunSik's dishes fall under the Korean category of bunsik, or snacks, including blood sausage embedded with sticky rice, kabocha porridge and a skewered hot dog with an airy crust of panko, like a corn dog from the fairy realm."
"Saxon & Parole","Saxon & Parole has an all-American, horsy-but-sleek ambience and a menu of modern surf and turf."
"La Vara","The newest vessel in the small and nimble Spanish armada commanded by Alex Raij and her husband and co-chef, Eder Montero, who also own Txikito and El Quinto Pino in Manhattan."
"Cookshop","Cookshop's virtuous approach to food which might be a bit much but for this: it's also allowing for a merry, heedless time."
"Caffe Buon Gusto","Low-end mix-and-match pasta places, and not bad for the price."
"Kuma Inn","Kuma Inn, serving a kind of Asian tapas, is an auteur restaurant if there ever was one, sprung entirely from the chef King Phojanakong's imagination."
"Bar Pitti","This casual Café adjacent to Da Silvano offers superbly simple Tuscan fare and draws a stylish, youthful crowd."
"Hibino","A menu that's an ode to tofu, coupled with a serene vibe."
"Cafe Condesa","Cafe Condesa's menu is simple, with reined-in flourishes and dishes that are creative enough to entice but not to challenge."
"David Burke Kitchen","A long, brightly lighted, almost-not-awkward space, serving yet another version of the chef David Burke's antic New American fare."
"Roberta's","The food at Roberta's, which is known for its pizzas, is as confident and relaxed as the scruffy clientele."
"Al di Là","Al Di La is an ideal neighborhood restaurant that's become much more than a neighborhood restaurant."
"Otto Enoteca Pizzeria","Otto is a pleasure in almost every way."
"Cafécito","Cafécito, a sweet little restaurant in Alphabet City, offers authentic Cuban dishes, tempered by contemporary American dietary customs."
"Babycakes","The vegan bakery’s stand on the Rockaway Beach Boardwalk."
"Redeye Grill","Huge and lively, with something for everyone on the menu."
"BLT Market","The adherence to trademark BLT touches, such as folksy bread at the start, prompts cynicism, but Laurent Tourondel seems to be making an earnest effort with the food."
"Spice Symphony","Spice Symphony specializes in a subset of Indian cooking that gleefully appropriates Chinese flavors to strange and often wondrous ends."
"Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichuan","A spare and modern restaurant on Flushing’s Main Street with terrific food, devoted to the cuisine of Hunan province."
"Congee Bowery","A multilevel Chinese place with shark fins on display by the register and a private karaoke hall in the basement."
"Lobster Joint","A soothing, blue-hued space where drinks like a super-spicy Dark & Stormy go great with a tarragon-accented lobster roll."
"Balthazar","It is never easy getting in, but once you are at your table, your cocoon, the charms of Balthazar take over."
"Bar Jamón","Bar Jamón, from Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich, is a temple to ham, and is true to the boisterous spirit of a Spanish tapas bar."
"Mary's Fish Camp","The short menu sticks to the basics at this spin-off of Pearl Oyster Bar."
"Khao Sarn","This sweet and simple place in Williamsburg seems emblematic of the neighborhood."
"Ellary's Greens","Ellary’s Greens is not so much a restaurant as dining rehab. The menu is devoted to natural and organic foods, and Leith Hill, the owner, is serious about closing the divide between good-for-you and delicious."
"Madangsui","The best of Manhattan's Korean barbecue restaurants."
"Flora Bar","Flora Bar, inside the Met Breuer, is less a restaurant than a wine bar, with small, tidily formal plates and a drinks list as exhaustive as any artist’s career retrospective."
"Scalinatella","Upper East Side Italian, offering an assortment of pasta, fish, chicken and veal dishes."
"Amaranto","Fermin Teco, the chef at this outwardly placid, modest family-run Mexican restaurant in a former corner bodega, has a gentle way with ingredients that allows flavors to emerge decorously rather than shove themselves forward."
"The Gumbo Bros","The chef Adam Lathan grew up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, in Creole country; his business partner, Clay Boulware, comes from Cajun central Louisiana. Former college roommates, they reunited in New York a few years ago to redress the city’s scarcity of gumbo. Here, in a space full of New Orleans-inspired touches, Mr. Lathan serves a Cajun gumbo that speaks in smoke, and a Creole style that relies on the sweetness of shrimp and blue crabs."
"Blue Smoke","Since opening in 2002, Blue Smoke has always been a few paces behind the frontrunners of New York barbecue. But when it comes to contemporary Southern cooking, Jean-Paul Bourgeois’s menu is at the head of the pack."
"Pondicheri","There isn’t another restaurant in the city quite like Pondicheri, where from breakast through dinner the flavors of India are imported into American daily life."
"The Beatrice Inn","It’s called a chophouse, but the Beatrice Inn is not a place for cautious eaters seeking refuge from the unknown. The menu, almost entirely devoted to meat, is an opportunity to take chances and eat with abandon."
"Goodburger","Those who don't like beef might dine elsewhere."
"Kappo Masa","The chef Masa Takayama, who owns this restaurant with the art dealer Larry Gagosian, is known for sushi, of course, but Kappo Masa presents a general overview of Japanese cuisine. The cost of eating at Kappo Masa is so brutally, illogically, relentlessly high, and so out of proportion to any pleasure you might get, that the prices become inescapable companions of your meal."
"The Kosher Marketplace","The Kosher Marketplace, a grocery on the Upper West Side with a nice selection of prepared foods, takes  a conventional approach to kosher cooking. Side dishes are particularly good and would make great picnic fare."
"Talde","A veteran of Vong in Chicago and Buddakan in New York before his time on “Top Chef,” Dale Talde has a well-polished knack for translating Asian dishes for popular tastes."
"Wondee Siam","This small takeout shop on Ninth Avenue offers full-flavored Thai dishes that can be terrifically satisfying."
"Jewel Bako","Open since 2001, Jewel Bako itself still has an impressive array of sushi and sashimi, some of it very fine. But a crowded field of competitors has raised the sushi bar."
"Nice Matin","Nice Matin gives the Upper West Side a splash of Provençal sunshine and a heady introduction to the cuisine of Nice."
"Bakeri","Cozy and ambitious, the bakery and sandwich shop Bakeri makes its own bread, simmers its own jam and even churns its own butter."
"Tanoreen","A lively, happy scene in Bay Ridge, set beneath clouds of lamb, mint and garlic scents combined."
"Le Restaurant","If you are an omnivore  who dreams about uncommon ingredients and pure, focused flavors, then Ryan Tate’s tasting menus are absolutely worth it."
"Burma Noodle Bar","At this makeshift stand in the Industry City Food Hall, the owner Eugene Saw offers samusas — flatter and daintier than Indian samosas — and three bowls of noodles, each better than the last, no matter what order you eat them in."
"Culture Espresso Bar","One of the few serious coffee bars in Midtown."
"The East Pole","The East Pole is the uptown spinoff of the vaguely British fashion-crowd canteen the Fat Radish, on the Lower East Side. The loveliest dishes revolve around vegetables."
"Tap Room 307","With more than 40 delicious drafts from around the world, this breezy sports bar gets packed with young suds heads in the evening. At lunchtime, though, it’s a nice, quiet spot for excellent, unusual beers."
"Ushiwakamaru","This ragtag subterranean haunt on Houston Street offers up some relative bargains, and it's a real culinary adventure that you don't find at just any sushi place."
"La Fonda Boricua","La Fonda Boricua in East Harlem is a handsome little place that offers big helpings of excellent Puerto Rican home cooking."
"Brad's","A casual spot for sandwiches, pizza and beer near New York University."
"Danji","A new-style Korean take on a Japanese izakaya."
"Bread Tribeca","Taking its cue from the Liguria region of Italy, Bread Tribeca offers food that is simply prepared and delicious."
"Battersby","At its best, the food at Battersby is thoughtful, poised, occasionally revelatory. The menu of about a dozen dishes changes as often as three times a week. Best to submit to the five- or seven-course tasting, which the chefs improvise on the spot, for half what you might pay across the river. This is fine dining in hipster’s clothing: the new new Brooklyn."
"Vosges Haut-Chocolat","A self-consciously glam chocolate spot."
"The Tangled Vine","An excellent wine bar on the Upper West Side serving Mediterranean fare."
"Margon","A decidedly shabby aisle-size Cuban restaurant, which does a thriving breakfast and lunchtime business, serving huge portions of delicious food at very low prices."
"Má Pêche","It’s nothing like the other restaurants in David Chang’s Momofuku confederation — of which Má Pêche is the largest and the first not in the East Village."
"Minton’s","The kitchen is a little unpredictable, and the success of dinner at Minton’s depends on how much you like to hear jazz musicians skittering around a tune, toying with a rhythm, tying and untying knots of harmony."
"Adrienne's Pizza Bar","Pizza purists may be happiest with Adrienne's nighttime pies, rendered with precision in a Neapolitan style."
"Café de la Esquina","This offshoot La Esquina, housed in a restored '50s diner, has a friendlier door policy than its Manhattan counterpart."
"F.O.B.","The chef, Armando Litiatco, was born in the Philippines and grew up in Daly City, Calif., which has the country’s highest concentration of people of Filipino descent. Here he serves delicate versions of classic Filipino dishes, in a gracious dining room with roomy chairs and light bulbs that rest like cockatoos in wrought-iron bird-cage lanterns. Food comes on grandmotherly, mismatched china; family members beam from framed photos."
"Estela","What takes you by surprise at Estela is Ignacio Mattos’s cooking. The food is almost familiar, but not quite, and it’s the little differences that get under your skin."
"Sea Witch","At this nautically themed pub, there’s a quaff-worthy selection of fresh and tasty American craft drafts and a menu of modest but excellent bar sandwiches"
"Grand Sichuan St. Marks","Grand Sichuan St. Marks in the East Village, one of a small chain of Grand Sichuan restaurants in Manhattan, is a good place to deepen your understanding of Sichuan cuisine."
"Home","Creative interpretations of Middle American dishes."
"Maharlika","Maharlika bills its fare as “Filipino Moderno,” which means home cooking boosted by good ingredients and classic technique."
"Los Perros Locos","Los Perros Locos translates as mad dogs, a fair description of the house specialty: hot dogs in the ornate Colombian style."
"Jo Jo","Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Jo Jo has shown, with extraordinary grace, how a restaurant can age without looking old."
"Tang Pavilion","You'll find that the many elegant Chinese customers ask for the the special Shanghai menu. Order from it, and you too can get the city's finest Shanghai cuisine, like eel with yellow chives."
"Lake Trout","Lake Trout’s name refers to a working-class Baltimore specialty that is neither lake in origin nor trout. It consists of whiting, a salt-water bottom-feeder, deep fried and flung on white bread."
"Chicks To Go","At this Peruvian pollería (rotisserie-chicken shop) a block from the beach, chicken is saturated for half a day with cumin, oregano, garlic, soy and smoky aji panca pepper, then turned over flame until the skin blisters and shimmers and the juices run mad within. Some of the meat is destined for aji gallina, a creamy stew that is all the more luxurious when it spills out of an otherwise ordinary-looking empanada; or for chaufa, from the Chinese chao fan (fried rice), even better made with quinoa grown in Peru."
"Marlow & Sons","Marlow and Sons' saloonlike dining room, done up in battered wood, mirrors and marble, is a near-perfect spot for cocktailing and oyster slurping."
"Larb Ubol","To a passer-by, there is little to distinguish Larb Ubol from the 30 or so pad-Thai joints that are its neighbors in Hell’s Kitchen. But the chef and owner, Ratchanee Sumpatboon, does not cook the Thai food most Americans know."
"Zabb Elee","Food from Isan, the region of northeast Thailand that borders Laos and Cambodia, is offered with unusual attention to freshness and complexity of flavor."
"The Commodore","A dive bar with great vaguely Southern food that feels as if it’s been around forever."
"Okonomi","Japanese breakfast is the specialty here, served until afternoon as a set menu that includes rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables, a choice of fish and two amuse-bouche-size sides."
"67 Burger","The seven-ounce charbroiled chuck burger, with an abundance of black pepper, is as juicy as the restaurant’s vibe."
"Crif Dogs","Thanks to the efforts of two New Jersey boys who dared to dream, hot dogs may once again get some respect."
"Rayuela","A beautiful, fascinating, frustrating place, &quot;reestyle Latino&quot; restaurant Rayuela strives hard to impress."
"Ed's Chowder House","This food will do in a pinch: late to Lincoln Center, famished, in need of a beer."
"Joseph Leonard","Joseph Leonard may become as adept at feeding its Greenwich Village neighbors as it has been at gauging their taste in décor."
"Prospect","As conceived by Annika Loureiro, the pastry chef, desserts at Prospect are an extension, and possibly the fullest realization, of the themes and intent of the preceding meal."
"Pravue Cafe and Albanian Grill","At Pravue Cafe in Ridgewood, Queens, the menu alternates between dishes that look to the West and those that stay true to Albania, made from recipes passed down through generations."
"Roc Restaurant","This breezy neighborhood spot in TriBeCa wanders all over the Italian map, serving food that can be wondefully simple and fresh, or downright strange."
"Soy","Plenty of New York restaurants try to manufacture a sense of hominess, but Soy feels like an actual offshoot of someone’s apartment. Crammed with odd debris (you can’t miss the toy Godzilla on a shelf), it has occupied a sleepy cubbyhole on Suffolk Street for more than a decade, and during those years the restaurant’s chef and owner, Etsuko Kizawa, has specialized in cooking her own gentle and maternal version of Japanese comfort food."
"Lilia","Missy Robbins’s first restaurant as an owner and the chef specializes in exceptional pasta and grilled Italian seafood."
"Landmarc","The new Landmarc in the Time Warner Center is three times the size of its original place in TriBeCa, whose menu and competent cooking it replicates but whose warmth it largely lacks."
"The Pines","The Pines looks like an indie band sounds: dark, moody, a little uncomfortable, cobbled together in a hurry and brimming with allusions."
"Bab al Yemen","The food at this Yemeni restaurant transports you to not only another place, but also another time."
"Cafe con Leche","These colorful, modern Hispanic restaurants specialize in robust Cuban and Dominican dishes."
"Buttermilk Channel","Buttermilk Channel makes clear that it's a restaurant with real standards, noteworthy ambition and a definite slavishness to trends."
"BLT Steak","At Laurent Tourondel's BLT Steak, there is a soft touch in the cooking, a sensitivity to acute flavors and seasonal ingredients."
"Casa Lever","This new Italian restaurant is of the Manhattan old school, built for socialites and those who finance them."
"Van Horn","As much a tasteful spot for the stroller set as a place to grab a beer and a plate of something fried and Southern to eat with your fingers."
"Annisa","It’s not easy to sum up Anita Lo’s style, which adroitly mixes ideas from around the world. What is remarkable about her food, though, is not exactly the absence of borders but the ease with which she crosses them."
"Jungsik","A Korean fine-dining restaurant, where a suave sabayon with Arctic char might be injected with the unruly heat and sourness of kimchi."
"TBar Steak and Lounge","An Upper East Side steak outpost that comforts diners, not challenges them."
"Oiji","Oiji in some ways continues the mission of the previous occupant, Dok Suni, of updating and translating Korean cuisine with respect, but the two chefs, Brian Kim and Tae Kyung Ku, aim for a little French-style nuance, too."
"Kura","At the sushi counter at Kura, the chef, Norihiro Ishizuka, works the crowd with a genial smile and a generous hand, making sushi with substantial cuts of fish, tricky to eat in a single bite but beautifully fresh."
"Brooklyn Fare","There are but 18 seats at this exquisite little restaurant attached to a grocery store on Schermerhorn Street in downtown Brooklyn."
"DB Bistro Moderne","A lively, even raucous restaurant from Daniel Boulud that tries to pass for a bistro but can't quite disguise its high-class leanings."
"Two Boots","This pizzeria, which has several branches in the East Village and Greenwich Village, is famous for a vegetarian pie, the Earth Mother, which delivers so much flavor you can actually ignore the fact that there is no mozzarella."
"Hearth","When he opened Hearth in 2003, Marco Canora, its chef, set out to adapt the transparency of Tuscan cooking to his own region and time of year. Mr. Canora gets few points for the originality of his vision, but for his fidelity to it, his score is off the charts."
"Freemans","Freemans has an eccentric, furtive atmospheric allure unlike any other Manhattan restaurant's."
"Phayul","At Phayul, whose name means fatherland in Tibetan, the food is lively and rugged, true to what you might find in the alpine villages of Kham and on the austere steppe of Amdo."
"Fisherman's Dawta","At this languidly cluttered Jamaican spot, do not expect speed. Time expands. All will come, including jerk chicken whose coy sweetness gives way to blindsiding heat."
"Felidia","The enduringly splendid Istrian and northern Italian food at Felidia shows that Lidia Bastianich isn't neglecting her roots."
"Gobo","A destination restaurant for the yuppie and established vegan sets."
"Lafayette","Lafayette is like a junior Eataly for Francophiles. As for the food, there are salads and charcuterie and oysters and shoestring fries. Almost all of it is worthy, but very little seduces you."
"Gyro96","At this 85-square-foot falafel shop steps from the 96th Street subway station, Waled Haredy, a native of Egypt, offers gyro at street-cart prices and makes falafel to order from his mother’s recipe, which belonged to her mother and her grandmother before her."
"The Halal Guys","It started as a nameless food cart on 53rd Street and Avenue of the Americas serving platters of lamb and chicken. Today this business, officially named the Halal Guys, comprises four carts and two restaurants in New York, with franchises set to open around the country and abroad."
"Szechuan Gourmet","Szechuan Gourmet doesn't quite reach the championship level of Sichuan cuisine, but it is a contender."
